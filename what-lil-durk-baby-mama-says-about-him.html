Nicole is mama to Durk's two eldest children, Angelo and Bella. The same year that Bella was born, Durk and Covone went their separate ways.</p><p>By all accounts, Durk was a pretty good dad to all his kids, and fans know he's got the cash to back up their everyday needs (and of course, spoil them, too). Then again, Nicole -- and likely the other babies' moms -- isn't always happy with how Durk handles himself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lil Durk Slammed With Paternity Issue While He Mourns His Brother</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on August 5th, 2021, by Michael Chaar:&nbsp;</strong>Lil Durk is known for his many hit songs, including 'Backdoor' and 'All Love' soaring him to international fame and success. While his rap game has been on an incline ever since his debut, so has his status as a father. Lil Durk welcomed his sixth child with his current girlfriend, India Royale, and the two are getting off to a great start. Despite being a great dad and having a number of just as great baby mama's, one of them isn't too happy. Nicole Covone, who shares two kids with the rapper,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had some choice words for him</a> when he claimed he wanted to take all of his children away from their mothers so he could raise them himself. Covone urged Lil Durk to stay off of social media, and do better as a dad. Ouch!</p><h2 id=lil-durk-s-online-comments>Lil Durk's Online Comments</h2><p>After&nbsp;one cringe-worthy Instagram post back in 2016, Nicole had some choice words for Durk, who she suggested wasn't quite in his right mind when he went on his social media rant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The thing is, it seemed like tensions were pretty low between the ex-partners prior to what Durk posted. Then, he got his number one "baby mama" mad. So what did he say?</p><p>Durk took to Instagram in "the middle of the night," says&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bossip</a>, and basically said he wanted to take all his children away from their moms and raise them in his "mansion."</p><p>Specifically, he said, "I need all my kids in 1 house calling lawyers." What's surprising is that over 10K of Durk's followers liked his post... He even elaborated that "this what makes me a real daddy" -- even though, as he admitted, his kids' moms are all "perfect and good."</p><p>What Durk was basically saying is that he wanted all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his kids to grow up in the same house </a>(with maids rather than their moms), because it would allow him to "grow mentally" and "be able to go reach" his "peak."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Slam Tekashi 6ix9ine For Mocking Lil Durk's Violent Home Invasion</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-covone-comes-for-lil-durk>Nicole Covone Comes For Lil Durk</h2><p>Every parent can relate to knowing their kids are safe at home in bed each night, but in Durk's case, he's got a handful of mothers of his kids watching out for them.</p><p>And that's exactly what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole followed up with after Durk's post</a>. She noted that while Durk was a "great father" to their two kids, she wasn't really sure what was going on with him at that moment. She said it seemed like Durk "wants some attention" and that he "gotta be talking to his other 10 BABYMAMAS" in saying that he's "taking somebody's kids."</p><p>Nicole reiterated her point by saying "he knows it ain't flying this way" and suggesting that Durk "stop the foolery."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Durk seemingly wised up after his rant, and it seems like he remains on good terms with all the moms of his kids these days.</p><h2 id=who-is-lil-durk-dating-now>Who Is Lil Durk Dating Now?</h2><p>While Lil Durk has certainly had his fair share of romances in the past, the rapper is currently dating India Royale. The duo welcomed their baby girl, Willow earlier this year, and sparked up a relationship since announcing the news of their pregnancy.</p><p>Willow became Lil Durk's sixth child, and while fans are thinking this will be his last, you never know with him, and considering India and Lil Durk are doing so well, they just might have another kid together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although extending their family is something to think about, the duo have their hands tied. Last month, Lil Durk and India had to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fight off home invaders</a> following a break-in, luckily for the duo, both them and Willow remained safe.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Owen Wilson's Baby Mamas?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrmquIydrKujXZeuo8WMppimmV2orrq%2FjJqZqK2kYrWquY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-lil-durk-baby-mama-says-about-him.html&text=Lil%20Durk%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Had%20This%20To%20Say%20About%20Her%20Ex&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-lil-durk-baby-mama-says-about-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-lil-durk-baby-mama-says-about-him.html&title=Lil%20Durk%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Had%20This%20To%20Say%20About%20Her%20Ex" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-lil-durk-baby-mama-says-about-him.html&title=Lil%20Durk%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Had%20This%20To%20Say%20About%20Her%20Ex" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-lil-durk-baby-mama-says-about-him.html&title=Lil%20Durk%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Had%20This%20To%20Say%20About%20Her%20Ex" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-lil-durk-baby-mama-says-about-him.html&description=Lil%20Durk%27s%20Baby%20Mama%20Had%20This%20To%20Say%20About%20Her%20Ex" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./melina-nasab-bio-ethnicity-height-job-age-bachelor-26.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Bachelor 26's Melina Nasab!
