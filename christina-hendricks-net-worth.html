She started dying her hair red at the age of ten (she is a natural blonde).</p><p>During her teen years, she relocated with her family to Fairfax, Virginia so that her father could be closer to his workplace in Washington, D.C. The move was traumatic for the teenaged Christina, and she described herself as a loner during high school. She found solace in theater and studied ballet.

Her rise to prominence on “Mad Men” even led to a 10% increase in breast augmentation surgery.
