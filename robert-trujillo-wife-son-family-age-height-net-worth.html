He played bass, went to many backyard and house parties, played musicians like Ozzy Osbourne and Led Zeppelin before enrolling in jazz school at age 19. years.&nbsp;His original intention was to become a session musician, but his passion for the sound he had fallen in love with took him in another direction.</span></p><p><span>In 1989 Robert Trujillo joined crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies also worked with funk metal supergroup Infectious Grooves.&nbsp;As part of Suicidal Tendencies, Trujillo has appeared in albums like&nbsp;</span><span>Lights…Camera…Revolution!&nbsp;</span><span>(1990),&nbsp;</span><span>The Art of Rebellion</span><span>&nbsp;(1992),&nbsp;</span><span>Still Cyco After All These Years</span><span>&nbsp;(1993), and&nbsp;</span><span>Suicidal for Life</span><span>&nbsp;(1994).&nbsp;Along with Infectious Grooves, which also had Suicidal Tendencies lead singer Mike Muir, Trujillo appeared on albums like&nbsp;</span><span>The Plague That Moves Your Booty… These Are the Infectious Grooves</span><span>&nbsp;(1991),&nbsp;</span><span>Sarsippius’ Ark</span><span>&nbsp;(1993),&nbsp;</span><span>Family Groove Cyco</span><span>&nbsp;(1994), and</span><span>Mas Borracho</span><span>&nbsp;(1999).</span></p><p><span>In the late 1990s, Trujillo got down to business with his idol Ozzy Osbourne collaborating on several of his albums before joining heavy metal band Metallica in 2003. Trujillo appeared on albums like&nbsp;</span><span>Death Magnetic</span><span>&nbsp;( 2008),&nbsp;</span><span>Lulu</span><span>&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;</span><span>Beyond the Magnetic</span><span>&nbsp;(EP) (2011), and&nbsp;</span><span>Wired… to self</span><span>&nbsp;-destruct (2016).&nbsp;Other bands he has played and worked with include Black Label Society and Mass Mental?.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Robert Trujillo is said to have an estimated net worth of around $20 million.&nbsp;The bass player who gained notoriety and popularity as a member of Suicidal Tendencies was able to accumulate such a fortune through the sale of music and royalties, especially through the various musical tours he participated in with his many collaborators.</span></p><p><span>Trujillo was paid a million dollars as an advance for joining Metallica.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – wife, son</span></strong></h2><p><span>Robert Trujillo is married to Chloé Trujillo, a visual artist, designer, painter and musician.&nbsp;Ms. Trujillo developed her love for the arts growing up and being raised in Paris, France by parents and grandparents of fashion designers who were classical musicians.&nbsp;However, despite all the creativity that surrounded her as a child, Chloe Trujillo did not start a career in the arts very early in life.&nbsp;She did this after spending some time studying the structure of matter and quantum mechanics.</span></p><p><span>Today she is known for her colorful work which combines aspects of ancient Aztec designs with skulls, eyes, flowers and birds.&nbsp;His works can be seen on various canvases all over the world.&nbsp;She is, however, also known for her designs on clothing accessories such as bags, bikinis, snickers, as well as skateboards and guitars, such as those used by her husband.</span></p><p><span>It is unclear when and when Chloe met her husband Robert, however, the couple have two children;&nbsp;a son named Tye and a daughter named Lulah.&nbsp;Tye is following in his father’s footsteps of playing bass, having started playing the instrument at the age of six.&nbsp;He performed as a member of The Helmets, which performed at the Lollapalooza Festival.&nbsp;He then made headlines by serving as bassist on the band Korn’s South American tour.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>The average height of a white American male is around 5 feet 10 inches.&nbsp;Robert Trujillo is one inch short of that mark with a height of 5 feet 9 inches (1.75m).&nbsp;Nevertheless, height is not a prerequisite for reaching the pinnacle of his chosen career where the rock star is doing well.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiqn5eys8CMramuopmhubB51qKdnmWjpLtussCmoKWxXZa0pnnHnqCgoKRiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frobert-trujillo-wife-son-family-age-height-net-worth.html&text=Robert%20Trujillo%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frobert-trujillo-wife-son-family-age-height-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frobert-trujillo-wife-son-family-age-height-net-worth.html&title=Robert%20Trujillo%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frobert-trujillo-wife-son-family-age-height-net-worth.html&title=Robert%20Trujillo%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frobert-trujillo-wife-son-family-age-height-net-worth.html&title=Robert%20Trujillo%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frobert-trujillo-wife-son-family-age-height-net-worth.html&description=Robert%20Trujillo%20Wife%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tanroh-ishida.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tanroh Ishida">&larr;
