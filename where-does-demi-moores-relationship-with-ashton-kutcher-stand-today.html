It didn’t take long for the former couple to form a relationship, with things turning serious between them rather quickly; they tied the knot two years later and lasted a whopping six years before things started to crumble in their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Moore’s relationship with the former Punk’d star had been plagued by reports that the latter had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cheated on his wife with multiple women,</a> and while that was initially believed to be nothing more but a rumor, her decision to end their marriage shortly after was all the confirmation fans needed to know that the allegations were factual after all.</p><p>In September 2019, the mother-of-three dropped her bombshell memoir, Inside Out, where she discussed her time with Kutcher in great detail, but where does their relationship stand today?</p><h2 id=is-demi-moore-still-close-to-ashton-kutcher>Is Demi Moore Still Close To Ashton Kutcher?</h2><p>According to Kutcher, who has since married his former That 70’s Show co-star Mila Kunis, having also welcomed two children together — Wyatt, 6, and Dimitri, 3 — he’s remained on friendly terms with his ex-wife.</p><p>In February 2020, he took part in an interview on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, insisting that all was well between him and Moore before adding that while they share a “good” relationship, they no longer “hang out” with one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Moore Reveals Who Her ‘Women Crush Wednesday’ Is In Her Recent Instagram Post</a></span></p><p>The 41-year-old actor-turned-tech entrepreneur further revealed that he still cares a lot for the actress’ three kids, Rumer, 31, Scout 28, and Tallulah, 26 — whom Moore shares with Hollywood veteran Bruce Willis — considering he helped raise the trio throughout their teenage years.</p><p>And while they are no longer as close as they used to be, Kutcher says he has a genuine bond with his ex’s kids, so much that if they ever needed him, the father-of-two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wouldn’t hesitate to make himself available to their needs</a>.</p><p>“Tallulah was eight or nine, she was the youngest. Rumer was 12 or 13 when we first started dating. When we were getting divorced, Tallulah was graduating high school,” he gushed. “I was helping raise teenage girls through their adolescence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I love them. I’m never going to stop loving them and respecting them and honoring them and rooting for them to be successful in whatever they are pursuing. I was never trying to be their father. I always had respect and honored Bruce [Willis], and I think he’s a brilliant human being and a wonderful man.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Moore Shares Fond Memories Of Joel Schumacher After News Of His Sudden Passing</a></span></p><p>His positive words about Moore’s kids were quite the contrast to the tweet he shared after reading some of the excerpts from his ex-wife’s controversial memoir last year, in which she detailed how she learned about the actor’s secret affairs.</p><p>From allegations that Kutcher asked for threesomes with his wife to suffering a miscarriage at six months into the pregnancy, there were plenty of things said that fans certainly weren’t aware of — at least no in such great detail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response to what was written in the book, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kutcher tweeted and deleted</a>: "I was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet. Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it.”</p><p>The comment appeared to insinuate that the 42-year-old would have shared his side of the story — which apparently wouldn’t have been a pleasant one — but considering that he has a family to think about before anything else, he decided not to share the snarky tweet after all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Much Mila Kunis Makes Voicing Meg Griffin On ‘Family Guy’</a></span></p><p>Whatever it is that Kutcher would’ve wanted to tell the world, it wouldn’t have changed the fact that Moore lost their baby and that he appeared to have cheated on her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about the heartbreaking miscarriage in her book, the Charlie’s Angels star explained: “I can’t even bring into words how lost, empty, desperate, confused [I was]. I really lost sight of everything that was right in front of me, which was the family I had.</p><p>“And I think that the weight that it put on Ashton, it’s kind of a natural thing to pull back, when somebody’s clinging too tight.”</p><p>And while both parties have moved on with their lives, Moore and Kutcher continue to collaborate on their human rights company Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children, which is helping address the sexual exploitation of minors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she’s been on dates here and there, Moore, for the most part, has chosen to remain single for the foreseeable future, and by the look of things, that decision has certainly worked in her favor as she’s not only managed to end her drug addiction but, as revealed in her book, she’s also learned to find peace with herself.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Divided Over Ashton Kutcher’s Post About Science Vs Fiction</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqlu8SsZJ2dnZ56rrvOq5ysZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4tdOhZJqrmKm8r3nKrqucoJWnerTAwKebZqyfma66ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html&text=Where%20Does%20Demi%20Moores%20Relationship%20With%20Ashton%20Kutcher%20Stand%20Today%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html&title=Where%20Does%20Demi%20Moores%20Relationship%20With%20Ashton%20Kutcher%20Stand%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html&title=Where%20Does%20Demi%20Moores%20Relationship%20With%20Ashton%20Kutcher%20Stand%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html&title=Where%20Does%20Demi%20Moores%20Relationship%20With%20Ashton%20Kutcher%20Stand%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-does-demi-moores-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-stand-today.html&description=Where%20Does%20Demi%20Moores%20Relationship%20With%20Ashton%20Kutcher%20Stand%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./which-is-worse-jail-or-prison.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which is worse jail or prison?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-does-it-mean-to-tarry-in-the-bible.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What does it mean to tarry in the bible">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
