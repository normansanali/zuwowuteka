The whole story is presented in the new television series “Mastermind of Murder.” The series created by the Oxygen network demonstrates how desperate some people can get to take horrific revenge against those they believe have wronged them.</p><p>The crime is never just solved after the killer is found in the hour-long episode series. Instead, these murder investigations offer two answers, who fired the shot and who was the plan’s mastermind. Season two of the show was released on July 17, 2022.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-johnny-borizov></span>What Happened To Johnny Borizov?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2013, a judge gave Johnny Borizov three consecutive life sentences for planning the killings of Jeffrey, Lori, and Michael Kramer, his ex-girlfriend’s family.</p><p>Johnny was imprisoned for the planning and executing of the murders of Jeffrey, Lori, and Michael Kramer for three consecutive life terms without the possibility of release.</p><p>Michael was Angela’s brother; Lori and Jeffrey were her parents.&nbsp;Jacob Nodarse&nbsp;killed Jeffrey, Lori, and Michael in 2010, thanks to Borizov’s manipulation. Following his sentencing in DuPage County, he currently resides at the high-security Stateville Correctional Center in Illinois.</p><p>As part of a plea agreement, Nodarse admitted guilt to the murder of Jeffrey Kramer in 2011; hence, the other two killings were not punished. Throughout the four-week trial, he provided evidence against Borizov.</p><p>The trial marked the first in the Chicago area to permit cameras during testimony. Borizov declined to defend himself on the witness stand. The defense filed a motion for a new trial. The judge initially rejected some of the defense’s arguments before completely rejecting the motion.</p><p>After learning of the decision, Borizov’s family said that “great injustice” had been done and that many of the claims made in court were untrue.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=angela-kramer-murder-mastermind-update-2022></span>Angela Kramer Murder Mastermind Update 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2022, Johnny Borizov is still in prison, and his health condition is deteriorating with each passing day.</p><p>His mother, Christina, pleaded for her son to receive medical attention in a Visible Magazine story published in 2021, stating he has kidney failure and is receiving dialysis.</p><p>After Christina went to the regional director of the Illinois Department of Corrections, he did receive fistula surgery; however, his diagnosis is three to five years. In prison, Johnny also developed pneumonia.</p><p>According to doctors, Johnny may only have a few months to live and will probably die in jail. He has fourteen additional underlying diseases, including severe diabetes, kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and others, and they are all becoming worse.</p><p>Similarly, Jacob Nodarse, who was persuaded to do the murder, is also still in prison. Jacob collaborated with law enforcement after being detained to develop a case for Johnny that would result in a lesser punishment. He was jailed for 75 years at this time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-johnny-borizov-kill-girlfriend-family></span>Why Did Johnny Borizov Kill Girlfriend Family?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Borizov and Angela Kramer became involved in a custody dispute over their kid after their breakup.</p><p>He started to act hostilely against her, and she was afraid he would take her kid Nicholas and leave her behind. Hence, Johnny planned the murder of his girlfriend and her family out of animosity.</p><p>Kramer was present when her brother and mom were killed. She recalled someone shooting her parent after breaking into their Darien house at around three in the morning. She lost her family, but she was able to flee and remain alive. Moreover, she appeared in court at the time of the trial with a new fiance.</p><p>Nodarse, who committed the violent crimes in 2010, provided significant testimony during Johnny’s prosecution. Nodarse related the story of how he first met him. Initially, Nodarse and victim Michael Kramer were good friends, but the two fell out once Nodarse became friends with Borizov.</p><p>According to him, Borizov had turned into his only friend and had isolated him by persuading him that Michael and Angela Kramer were planning to have him assassinated due to a child custody struggle between them. Nodarse also came to believe that Johnny ran a criminal organization and that the Kramer family was applying pressure to the criminal organization as a result of the custody dispute.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMo6ahpp6ueqO70aKxqK5doq60wMSrpKKmlGK2r3nAp56epJFiuLOtzJ6pZqWlp7GmvoywmKxlpJ22tHnEsWSbp6mbv6qxzZ1m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-borizov-mastermind-in-angela-kramer-murder-was-this-ex-boyfriend.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Borizov%3f%20Mastermind%20In%20Angela%20Kramer%20Murder%20Was%20This%20Ex%20Boyfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-borizov-mastermind-in-angela-kramer-murder-was-this-ex-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-borizov-mastermind-in-angela-kramer-murder-was-this-ex-boyfriend.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Borizov%3f%20Mastermind%20In%20Angela%20Kramer%20Murder%20Was%20This%20Ex%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-borizov-mastermind-in-angela-kramer-murder-was-this-ex-boyfriend.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Borizov%3f%20Mastermind%20In%20Angela%20Kramer%20Murder%20Was%20This%20Ex%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-borizov-mastermind-in-angela-kramer-murder-was-this-ex-boyfriend.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Borizov%3f%20Mastermind%20In%20Angela%20Kramer%20Murder%20Was%20This%20Ex%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-borizov-mastermind-in-angela-kramer-murder-was-this-ex-boyfriend.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Borizov%3f%20Mastermind%20In%20Angela%20Kramer%20Murder%20Was%20This%20Ex%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nope-alien-plush.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where To Buy Nope Movies Alien Viewer Masks And Alien Plush Toy?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./victoria-anne-theresa-peterson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Victoria Anne Theresa Peterson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
