Unfortunately, the Food Network decided to cancel Valerie's Home Cooking in 2023. The final episode aired in July. The reason for the cancelation is unknown.</p><p>Largely due to all the shows that she has headlined following her divorce, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertinelli currently has a $20 million fortune</a>.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Valerie also found love again after Van Halen.
