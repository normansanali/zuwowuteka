His role as detective Carter alongside Hollywood superstar<a href=#> Jackie Chan</a> earned him a <strong>$3 million</strong> salary.</p><p>Audiences immediately loved Tucker’s and Chan’s chemistry on screen, and the film went on to gross a massive <strong>$244 million</strong> at the box office.</p><p>Even though it seemed like he was underpaid for the first installment, Tucker, as clever as he is, negotiated a <strong>$20 million</strong> to appear in the sequel of the film in 1999.</p><p>If we were to adjust inflation, that’s the same as earning <strong>$40 million</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ChrisTuckerJackieChan.jpg><p>The salary was enough to make him one of the highest-paid and sought-after actors on the planet.</p><p>For his next project, Tucker negotiated a <strong>$40 million</strong> two-movie contract with New Line Cinema.</p><p>Out of the total amount, <strong>$25 million</strong> would be his salary for the third Rush Hour.</p><p>On top of that, Chris received 20% of the backend gross of Rush Hour 3.</p><p>So, in total, Chris bagged at least <strong>$50 million</strong> from his Rush Hour franchise which equates to around<strong> $65 million</strong> after inflation adjustments.</p><h3>Legal Issues</h3><p>Chris Tucker has a surprisingly low net worth despite making tons of money through his acting career.</p><p>This all can be attributed to some of the financial blunders he made over the years.</p><p>He was doing astonishingly well, but his finances began to get messy, and around 2011, Chris found himself drowning in Internal Revenue Service debt.</p><p>Chris missed some of his tax payments between the time frame of 2001 to 2005, his career peak, and in 2011, California tax filings and IRS revealed that he owed <strong>$11 million</strong> in taxes.</p><p>The debt had risen to<strong> $14 million</strong> by 2014.</p><p>Same year all his tax debt was finally settled.</p><p>One of the most valuable lessons one can learn from this is always do your taxes no matter how much you make because they’re watching you!</p><p><strong>Read About <a href=# rel=bookmark>Hilary Duff’s Net Worth: Career & Lifestyle</a></strong></p><h2>Net Worth of Chris Tucker in Different Currencies</h2><p>Chris Tucker’s net worth as of December 2023 is <strong>$5 million</strong>.
