Ken provided a different answer, going with DJ D-Wrek from Nick Cannon’s Wild ‘N Out show.</p><p>For the show’s I Wanna Rock episode, the character took the stage to perform Bon Jovi’s Always and had the panelists and audience soaking up the lyrical goodness.</p><p>Unfortunately, Husky’s performance wasn’t enough to move the character onto the finals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>An audience vote determined that Sea Queen and Tiki would face off later in the Battle Royale, while Husky would not.</p><p>That meant Husky had to unmask, and when the mask came off, it was R&B singer Ginuwine, known for his hit song Pony.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>In a post-episode interview with TV Insider, he revealed he decided to go on The Masked Singer to get out of his comfort zone.</p><p>“That was something that was new, and so after the pandemic hit back a couple years ago, I was just like, ‘Man, I gotta live a little instead of just staying in the house all the time, so try something different,'” he said.</p><p>Ginuwine also said he was pleased with them choosing the Husky as his specific costume for the competition show.</p><p>“Once they gave me the costume, it represents who I am — as a man, alpha male, knows what they want, going to get it, works hard — and it was just a nice costume and it was something that appealed to me right off the bat, so I was just happy they picked that one for me,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ginuwine-regrets-one-move-during-his-performance>Ginuwine regrets one move during his performance</h2><p>While the clue packages presented for Husky were helpful, Robin mentioned a carousel he thought referred to the hit single, Pony.</p><p>He also keyed in on a specific move he noticed the character doing while onstage. Robin mimicked the move and said he knew who it was because of that and his voice.</p><p>“I know that voice. I’ve heard your records. I’ve partied to your records. I still think this may be Ginuwine,” Robin said.</p><p>Following the airing of his Masked Singer elimination, the singer told <a href=#>TV Insider</a> he regretted incorporating the recognizable dance move into his performance.</p><p>“Yeah, I figured Robin would pick me out quicker than anyone because I know him, number one, and with the move and all that, which I regret doing, I was like, ‘Man, I shouldn’t have done that,’” Ginuwine shared.</p><p>“I knew they would get it after that because when Nicole [Scherzinger] was saying [her] guesses, she was very close, so that was going into that mode of, of course, gotta be G. It was fun standing there listening to them because some of the guesses were fun,” he said.</p><p>Following his reveal, Ginuwine blessed the panelists and audience with a small performance of his hit song Pony to break out that trademark dance move again.</p><p>The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on FOX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Sdsm65wKyinpxdqLavs8Srqmagpai4unnRnq2emZyoeqm10mapnp%2BimsFustGopGarlZbAsLqMamdmmZapsrN51Kekmqubnruoew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-masked-singers-husky-reveals-his-regret-from-season-10-after-unmasking.html&text=The%20Masked%20Singers%20Husky%20reveals%20his%20regret%20from%20Season%2010%20after%20unmasking&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-masked-singers-husky-reveals-his-regret-from-season-10-after-unmasking.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-masked-singers-husky-reveals-his-regret-from-season-10-after-unmasking.html&title=The%20Masked%20Singers%20Husky%20reveals%20his%20regret%20from%20Season%2010%20after%20unmasking" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-masked-singers-husky-reveals-his-regret-from-season-10-after-unmasking.html&title=The%20Masked%20Singers%20Husky%20reveals%20his%20regret%20from%20Season%2010%20after%20unmasking" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-masked-singers-husky-reveals-his-regret-from-season-10-after-unmasking.html&title=The%20Masked%20Singers%20Husky%20reveals%20his%20regret%20from%20Season%2010%20after%20unmasking" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-masked-singers-husky-reveals-his-regret-from-season-10-after-unmasking.html&description=The%20Masked%20Singers%20Husky%20reveals%20his%20regret%20from%20Season%2010%20after%20unmasking" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./david-mazouz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is David Mazouz?
