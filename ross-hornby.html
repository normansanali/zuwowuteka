Further, he had once auditioned for the role of ‘Harry Potter’ but was not chosen for the role.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66847 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ross-Hornby-childhood.jpg alt="Ross Hornby" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66847 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ross Hornby’s childhood picture. Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Fame>Rise to Fame</span></h2><p>Ross is a member of the Yogscast and a third of Hat Films. Ross, Chris Trott, and Alex Smith are particularly well known for playing Minecraft, Trials Evolution, and a variety of other games. Due to some of them having graduated in film production, their style of editing is often praised for being smooth and professional.</p><p>‘HAT Films’ is a production company that creates gameplay and other videos related to video games such as ‘Minecraft’ and ‘Trials Evolution’. Therefore, it all started when he was at the university, studying film and television. There, he met Chris Trott, Nathan Ashman, and Adams. Soon, they became best friends and often discussed their passion: video games. YouTube channel’s most popular video is “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">It’s like playing Russian Roulette FOR REAL?!</a>”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66851 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ross-Hornby-video.jpg alt="Chris Trott" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66851 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Chris Trott while in a video alongside his co-workers. Source: YouTube</p><h4>More</h4><p>Once, while discussing their plans, they collectively thought of venturing into the world of gaming. That is how ‘HAT Films’ was born. Initially, it was named ‘H.A.A.T Films,’ a name that originated from the initials of their surnames. And, after graduation, Nathan and Adams quit ‘H.A.A.T Films’ to pursue their ventures. Soon, Alex Smith was roped in and the venture was renamed.</p><p>Gradually, the trio managed to grab attention in the online gaming scenario. Moreover, their filming and editing skills were unique and innovative. Besides making gaming videos, ‘HAT Films’ began creating gaming trailers. They were approached by ‘Studiosos’ to creatMinecraftft’ skin trailers for their Xbox version. They later added songs, skits, and other entertaining content to their list.</p><p>‘HAT Films’ has its very own YouTube channel and provides gameplays of popular video games such as ‘Grand Theft Auto 5,’ ‘Trials,’ ‘Worms,’ and ‘TTT.’ They also create comedy sketches and skits. All their creations can be found on sites such as ‘Bandcamp’ and ‘iTunes.’ They even have their signature line of merchandise.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66850 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ross-Hornby-three.jpg alt="Ross Hornby" width=650 height=517 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66850 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ross Hornby, Alex Smith, and Chris Trott clicking a photo. Source: Instagram</p><h4>Ross’ Association</h4><p>The ‘HAT Films’ trio is now a name to reckon with, in the gaming arena. The team’s efforts to deliver high-quality entertainment are commendable. Entertainment comes naturally to this trio. They try not to follow the conventional path. For instance, in 2014, they arrived at the ‘Yogscast office dressed in rags.</p><p>Moreover, they were also drunk and were munching on caviar. He is the eldest of the three members. He usually stays away from the immature conversations between Smith and Trott. However, that does not make him less entertaining. He often cracks jokes with Smith and Trott.</p><p>At times, he even engages in jamming sessions with them. Moreover, he is the most skilled editor of the three. He has shown his incredible editing skills in several ‘HAT Films’ productions, especially in their ‘USA Roadtrip’ vlogs.</p><h4>Beyond HAT Films</h4><p>Similarly, apart from being part of ‘HAT Films,’ he has been associated with several other projects, too. He owns a YouTube channel named ‘djh3max’, which is also his online alias. However, the channel is not remarkably popular and has a little over two thousand subscribers. He has a Twitter account, too, where he posts about ‘HAT Films’ and its productions.</p><p>The online alias, ‘djh3max,’ has a history behind its inception. The ‘DJ’ in his alias stems from his past desire to become a DJ. The letter ‘h’ has been taken from his last name, while the digit ‘3’ is the number of siblings in his family. Moreover, he once owned a dog named ‘Max,’ which has contributed to the ‘max’ in his alias.</p><p>Additionally, he has several other usernames and online aliases such as ‘DjHD3DCinemax,’ ‘RossHORNY,’ ‘Rock,’ ‘Ground-Scrub,’ ‘Mickey Pokey,’ ‘Ross “Own Goal” Hornby,’ ‘Rob,’ and ‘Rossperu’.</p><p>The character ‘Ms. Sluggy Slugworth Slugworm’ was created by him while hosting an episode of ‘GTA5’. The character is a slug with a slurred voice. Moreover, he has worked as a voice artist, too. He has lent his voice to the character ‘Minion’ in the animating series Israphel Animated’.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66846 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ross-Hornby-cam.jpg alt="Ross Hornby" width=650 height=811 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66846 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ross Hornby tests the camera before making videos.
