And she took full advantage of those celebratory moments by going clubbing and partying and, not before long, she was known as the hottest party girl on the planet. The beautiful, freckled, redhead has made headlines more than a few times for her drinking and partying problem. According to People, as far back as 2006, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was <strong>blasted for being "irresponsible and unprofessional"</strong></a> by Morgan Creek Production CEO, James G. Robinson.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/lindsay-lohan-embarrassed-herself-and-may-have-ruined-her-music-career-during-a-disastrous-performance-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Lindsay Lohan May Have Ruined Her Music Career During One Disastrous Performance">Lindsay Lohan May Have Ruined Her Music Career During One Disastrous Performance</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>At the height of Lindsay Lohan's acting success, her attempt to create a music career went awry after a huge misstep embarrassed her.</p><p>Robinson said in the letter that <strong>Lindsay Lohan called in sick multiple times </strong>while on the set of her movie Georgia Rule. Lohan said that her absences were due to her "not feeling well," which later changed to "heat exhaustion." However, it was reported that <strong>she was briefly hospitalized</strong> for being "overheated and dehydrated" after she was seen at a nightclub the night before. Mr. Robinson also threatened legal action against Lohan, stating that her "actions have resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage." But, despite the evidence proving otherwise, a close source of Lohan's said that, "She hasn't been crazy partying... I've never seen her so together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-lindsay-lohan-have-a-history-of-being-late-or-absent-on-set><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Does Lindsay Lohan Have A History Of Being Late Or Absent On Set?</span></h2><h3 id=total-earnings-from-movies-28-million>Total Earnings from Movies: $28 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar52163517-1.jpg><p>Years after the incident in 2006, it appears that Lindsay Lohan didn't learn her lesson in developing a respectable work ethic. In 2010, Lohan was scheduled to do a stint on Season 3 of the comedy-drama television series, Glee. This was supposed to be a simple, one-time appearance on the show where she would play the role of herself. But, apparently, she played that role a bit too well by continuing to arrive late on set. According to Nicki Swift, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an inside <strong>source told E-News that she was a "total nightmare"</strong></a> and that she would arrive "three hours late in the morning."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But <a href=#>the Mean Girls star actress</a> didn't stop there, as <strong>her tardiness only seemed to continue</strong> with the progression of her acting career. The report continued to highlight her lack of professionalism when she appeared in a 2013 episode of Charlie Sheen's Anger Management sitcom.</p><p>During an interview with Jay Leno, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheen had this to say about his experience working with Lohan,</a> "Day one, she was fabulous. She was on time; she knew her lines... made is look off our game... Then we had to deal with day two... She was late, what can I say? But she got to the shoot prepared with an excuse." And you can rest assured that her habit of tardiness persisted despite her many chances.</p><h2 id=does-lindsay-lohan-have-a-history-of-theft><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Does Lindsay Lohan Have A History Of Theft?</span></h2><h3 id=current-net-worth-2-million>Current Net Worth: $2 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lindsay-Lohan’s-Biggest-Scandals-And-How-Shes-Making-Her-Hollywood-Comeback.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One would think that an internationally known actress like <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan, who was once worth $30 million,</a> would be able to afford everything she needs and more.

In 2009, she visited the showroom of jewelry designer Arielle de Pinto, where she "borrowed" several pieces of jewelry for a photo shoot. The designer label took her credit card information as insurance that she would return the jewelry, but she allegedly never returned the jewelry and then canceled her credit card before it could be charged. Here is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a list of all the other times Lohan has been accused of stealing</a> other people's property, according to Nicki Swift:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=5 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Item Allegedly Stolen</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Item Cost</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Year of Alleged Theft</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rolex Watch</p></td><td><p>$35,000</p></td><td><p>2010</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Necklace</p></td><td><p>$2,500</p></td><td><p>2011</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rolex Watches and other Jewelry</p></td><td><p>$100,000</p></td><td><p>2012</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rolex, clothes, and jewelry</p></td><td><p>$30,000</p></td><td><p>2017</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=has-lindsay-lohan-produced-a-string-of-box-office-bombs><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Has Lindsay Lohan Produced A String Of Box Office Bombs?</span></h2><h3 id=worst-ranked-movie-by-rotten-tomatoes-inappropriate-comedy>Worst Ranked Movie by Rotten Tomatoes: InAPPropriate Comedy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar52158489-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Lindsay Lohan first came out as a young actress in the 1998 romantic comedy, The Parent Trap, she hit the ground running. Against a budget of $15 million, the film grossed over $92 million, which isn't bad for her debut role. After that, <strong>2003's Freaky Friday grossed $160.8 million worldwide</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which remains her highest-grossing film</a>, according to The Richest. Keep in mind that she was only 16 at the time it was released. It's been over twenty years since then, and she's yet to produce a movie that exceeds that figure.</p><p>Following that, Lindsay Lohan produced other successful films, which made their budget money back at the box office. This is a list of the few films starring Lohan that were box-office successes:</p><ul><li>Mean Girls (2004): Grossed $130 million against an $18 million budget</li><li>Herby: Fully Loaded (2005): $144 million against a $50 million budget</li></ul><p>The films that followed where <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan played the lead role were all critical flops and box office bombs.</a> Movies like Bobby (2006), Just My Luck (2007), Georgia Rule (2007), I Know Who Killed Me (2007), and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004) all barely broke even at the box office or weren't even close. Hollywood is in the business of making money, so any actor with <strong>a record of repeated flopped movies</strong> is a liability.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-lindsay-lohan-committed-other-criminal-offenses><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Has Lindsay Lohan Committed Other Criminal Offenses?</span></h2><h3 id=longest-court-sentence-120-days-on-house-arrest>Longest Court Sentence: 120 days on house arrest</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/untitled-design-6.png><p>As if being accused of theft multiple times wasn't bad enough, Lindsay Lohan's rap sheet could rival her acting resume with the number of charges she's racked up over the course of her career. Taken from another Nicki Swift article, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lohan has been "officially" <strong>arrested seven times between 2007 and 2013</strong>.</a> It's unclear whether her life outside the film business was more exciting than her career as an actress, but it sure appears that way.</p><p>Among some of the arrests that were made, Lindsay Lohan was lucky enough to post bail or have the charges dropped. But, as you know, it takes quite a while for her to learn her lesson.

She's been blasted one too many times for either not showing up to work for days or consistently being late.
