He added to Vanity Fair: ‘It wasn’t forced on me in any way.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However others believe members are encouraged to outwardly adopt their ‘divine gender’. Ten ex-members told the publication the ‘Twin Flames Universe is coercing vulnerable people who have never experienced gender dysphoria to transition’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One ex-member said: ‘If those people in there are happy, I hope so. But I just think it’s all too likely that indoctrination made them believe that they were trans when they were f*****g fine before.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All current members disagreed, saying that no one has pressured them to transform anything about their bodies or lives.
