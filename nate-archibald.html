Early Life And Family</h2><p><strong>Shortly after Nathaniel “Tiny” Archibald</strong>, Nate Archibald was born in New York City, New York, to his parents, <strong>Julia Archibald</strong> and<strong> Big Tiny (nicknamed) Archibald</strong>.</p><p>He was the second son among six children and grew up in <strong>New York’s South Bronx</strong>. Within the glamour city of New York lies a place manifested with gangs, bullets, and violence.</p><p>The place gives rise to murders and drugs as if nothing happened, and the two-winged dreams get crushed into the ground. However, Nate could control it all, finding his escape in the basketball.</p><p>As he grew from a child to a teenager, he commenced shooting balls in the basket at a concrete, uneven playground. The determination that he carried from his teenage phase to school gets crushed one day.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>During his tenure in the DeWitt Clinton High School, he had only contributed one and a half-season for his school’s team until he was cut out.</p><p>Being a sophomore, he had to run with the junior teams, which gave birth to the idea of giving up. At that moment, his two mentors,<strong> Floyd Layne</strong> and <strong>Pablo Robertson,</strong>&nbsp;were the ones to show him the path of encouragement.&nbsp;</p><p>To illustrate, they were the former standout at Loyola of Chicago and Harlem. Thus, Archibald gave another chance at basketball and got reinstated on the squad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DeWitt-Clinton-High-School.jpg><p>In addition, the shy Archibald played a transition season at tiny Arizona Western College, where he rose as a high school star with an average of 29.5 points per game.</p><p>Right then, he began to work on his academics and transferred to the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). In UTEP, he stood as the point guard, where he worked under Hall of fame coach <strong>Don Haskins</strong>.</p><p>From 1967 to 1970, Archibald maintained attention towards him, especially since his 51-point performance in the 1970 Aloha Classic.</p><h2>How tall Is Nate Archibald?

You look at players like<a href=# rel=noopener> Charles Barkley</a> and Patrick Ewing and realize how lucky you were to win it all. I was able to persevere through the injuries and keep learning the game. I was the facilitator on a championship team.
