Ashley Benson is also popular as the lover of the British model and actress Cara Delevingne.</span></h3><h2><span id=Relationship_status>Relationship status</span></h2><p>Ashley Benson is currently <strong>single.</strong> She was in a relationship with the English model and actress Cara Delevingne from May 2018 to April 2020. The lovers had been together for almost two years now. The duo confirmed their relationship only after a year of being together on June 14, 2019, via Cara’s Instagram post. Let’s have a look at the history of the lovers’ relationships from the very beginning.</p><p>Cara and she kept their relationship fairly private for a year before confirming it during Pride Month of 2019. The “Pretty Little Liars” star and model and actress Cara Delevingne have been dating for over a year although they did not publicly confirm their relationship until Pride 2019.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-30647 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ashley-Benson-with-girlfriend-Cara-Delevingne.jpg alt="Ashley Benson" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-30647 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ashley Benson and her lover Cara Delevingne are seen kissing in public at the U.S. Open. Source: Youtube</p><h2><span id=How_did_their_relationship_begin>How did their relationship begin?</span></h2><p>The duo started as co-stars while filming the punk-rock drama “Her Smell” in 2018. In June, Delevingne confirmed she was dating Benson and the two reportedly moved in together. They are no longer shy about posting each other’s pictures on their respective social media accounts.</p><p>In April 2018, the two began filming the movie ‘Her Smell’. It is a punk-rock drama that began filming in April 2018. It stars Delevingne, Benson, and Elisabeth Moss. On May 3, 2018, Benson posted her first Instagram photo with Delevingne with the caption, “After 50 tries…we got a blurry one @caradelevingne ???”.</p><p>The duo was photographed holding hands with each other in late May 2018. Pride magazine commented on the pictures, noting that one photo showed Delevingne hugging Benson and appearing to kiss her neck. Other photos showed the two holding hands.</p><p>Similarly, in early August 2018, some fans speculated that Benson was wearing jewelry with her and Delevingne’s initials on it. She posted an Instagram selfie that showed off some of her jewelry, including a necklace with the letters “C” and “A.” According to Page Six, some fans began speculating that the letters stood for “Cara” and “Ashley.” Moreover, on August 14, 2018, the two were photographed kissing at London’s Heathrow Airport. As per Daily Mail, the two were spotted kissing shortly after they arrived there together.</p><p>On 18th August, Benson attended Delevingne’s 26th birthday party. Delevingne’s star-studded party included a photo booth where Benson took photos with the model and some of their friends, including Suki Waterhouse and Zoe Kravitz.</p><p>That same month, Benson told People Now that she keeps her relationships private and wouldn’t confirm or deny if she was dating Delevingne. The “Pretty Little Liars” star said she wouldn’t confirm or deny the reports that she was dating Delevingne, but she did open up about how she tries to stay out of the public eye. She said:</p><p>“I think it’s the best way in any relationship. I’ve always been very private about them and I think it’s just better … I just kinda try to keep myself as private as possible.”</p><h4>Public appearances before confirmation</h4><p>In September, she watched Delevingne walk at Paris Fashion Week. She sat in the front row at the Balmain show that Delevingne was modeling in for Paris Fashion Week. The two were later photographed leaving the show together as per Entertainment Tonight.</p><p>Additionally, in January 2019, the pair and some of their friends went to the Maldives. But the pair were spotted alone together a few times. Also, in February, Cara Delevingne visited her in Los Angeles where they were spotted getting lunch with friends and kissing.</p><p>Then in March, the two spent time in Paris together and with Delevingne’s sister. The duo was in Paris for Fashion Week and stylist Jamie Mizrahi, a friend of Benson’s, posted an Instagram of the cozied-up couple. She captioned the picture, “Post-show cuddle puddle.” That same day, Benson posted a photo of herself with Delevingne’s sister, Poppy, and Mizrahi.</p><h2><span id=Ashley_Benson_8211_The_Revelation>Ashley Benson – The Revelation</span></h2><p>Later in June, Cara Delevingne confirmed their relationship status. She mentioned that she and Benson were dating and the two reportedly moved in together. Cara captioned the post, “#PRIDE ?❤️??❤️? @ashleybenson”. It was a video clip from the “Her Smell” movie where she is kissing Ashley.</p><p>Later, Cara&nbsp;Delevingne told E! News why she wanted to go public with their relationship after a year of secrecy. She said:</p><p>“I don’t know, because it is Pride, it’s been 50 years since Stonewall happened and I don’t know. It’s been just about our one year anniversary so, why not?”</p><p>Cara also gave a speech at the TrevorLIVE Gala that seemed directed at Benson, who was also in attendance. She went on:</p><p>“I also have another very special woman in this room to thank and you know who you are. She’s one of the people who help me love myself when I needed it most and I really needed it. She showed me what real love is and how to accept it, which is a lot harder than I thought.”</p><p>That same month, Us Weekly reported that the pair had moved in together in Los Angeles, California, and that she had sold her house to live with Delevingne. In late June, the now-confirmed couple was photographed attending actress Zoe Kravitz and Karl Glusman’s rehearsal dinner and wedding in Paris, France.</p><h4>Tattoos and Public appearances</h4><p>Additionally, in July, people noticed that she had a ‘CD’ tattoo and that Delevingne had an ‘A’ inked in the same spot. Although it’s not clear what the tattoo stands for or when she got it, many fans point out that “CD” could stand for Cara Delevingne’s initials. Similarly, Cara Delevingne also has the letter “A” tattooed in the same spot that she has “CD”. It could stand for “Ashley,” although it’s also unclear when she got the ink and what it stands for.</p><p>On October 14, 2019, Delevingne received the 2019 Girl Up #GirlHero award for her advocacy for the LGBTQ community. Cara also said she is the ‘luckiest girl in the world’ because she has Benson in her life during her speech.</p><p>On Valentine’s Day 2020, Cara shared a photo of the lovers kissing and captioned it, “A kiss with a cause. This Valentine’s Day when you share a photo of you and a loved one— a significant other, a friend, a pet—you can also raise awareness and help create a future with more survivors thanks to the @su2c #KissCancerGoodbye campaign.”</p><p>In a rare public appearance, the couple arrived at the fall 2020 Boss show at Milan Fashion Week. During the show, they sat in the front row. In March, Delevingne shared a video of her and Benson recreating a scene from ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’.</p><h4>Prior Relationships</h4><p>Ashley Benson dated many other public figures before settling with Cara. She dated Tyler Blackburn from 2013 to 2016, Chord Overstreet in 2012, Ryan Good from 2011 to 2017, and Justin Thorne from 2006 to 2010. Likewise, she also had a rumored relationship with Nat Wolff in 2015 and with Taylor Lautner in 2012.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Ashley Benson’s full name is Ashley Victoria Benson.
