reaches.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These are performed by starting in a high boat position with your back straight, then leaning back slowly and bringing yourself back up with your knees to your chest.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Ting follows this with a round of roll-up toe taps, side plank crunch dips and sprinter sit-ups, which are just like regular sit-ups with your legs
