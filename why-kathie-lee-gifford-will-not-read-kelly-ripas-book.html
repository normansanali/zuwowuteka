When Kathie Lee Gifford decided to leave Live! after 15 years, many rumors went around. The one heard often was that she left due to fighting with Regis Philbin. That was simply not true.</p><p>Gifford stayed out of the public eye for years after her departure. She later revealed that she purposely shied away from the press because she was dealing with a personal family matter, and it was why she left Live!. Kathie Lee's father, Aaron Epstein, was dealing with a progressive brain disease, similar to Alzheimer's, called Lewey Body Dimentia.</p><p>“I knew it was going to be a horrendous family experience. I just had to have that time with him without cameras in my face and without having to explain things,” Kathie Lee told the New York Post. “I wanted my daddy to be able to die with the dignity in which he had lived his life.”</p><p>Her father died in 2002.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-kathie-lee-gifford-resent-kelly-ripa><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Did Kathie Lee Gifford Resent Kelly Ripa?</span></h2><p>The two ladies who sat next to Regis Philbin only had good things to say about each other through the years.</p><p>When Kelly Ripa took over her role, Kathie Lee Gifford said to the New York Times, "I think she's got the right combination of sparkle and sass."</p><p>When Kathie Lee landed the gig on Today, Kelly said, "I’m so excited for her,. Everybody’s like, ‘Have you ever met her?’ I’m like, 'Met her? I know her intimately!' I’m so happy for her. ... She’s very influential in my life. I saw her doing it all — a working mom.

During the show, Kelly had very fond words for the man who sat next to her for many years.</p><p>"They don't make them like Regis anymore," she told the audience. "What I love to remember about him is his relationship with my kids," she continued. "He would talk to them like they were adults no matter how old they were, and my kids responded to that. They worshiped him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan Seacrest also shared his thoughts, "I remember one morning after the show when we first started, he came down to the radio studio and gave me a hug," Seacrest told Ripa. "It was like a seal of approval. I cry a lot anyway, but I was really emotional about it. When I started, I wanted to be there for you, and I wanted him to approve the idea.

In it, <a href=#>she talks about much of her life including her husband, her family</a>, her time on All My Children, and so much more.

She told the People it made her feel "horrible" and it "felt like a pile-on".</p><p>She went on to say, “I understand that probably he didn’t want a co-host, but the network wanted me to be the co-host and I didn’t think I should pass up that opportunity. I don’t think it was fair to him. But it was also not fair to me.”</p><p>She also says that her friendship with Philbin "didn't really exist" and that working with him was "not a cakewalk".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everywhere Kelly Ripa And Mark Consuelos Have Homes</a></span></p><h2 id=were-regis-philbin-and-kathie-lee-gifford-friends><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Were Regis Philbin And Kathie Lee Gifford Friends?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Kathie Lee Gifford says that she and Regis Philbin had a 20-year friendship after she left </a><a href=#>Live!.</a></p><p>"We were each other's best audience.

"We worked together for 15 years and for the next 20 years, we just hung out as friends."</p><p>Regis also spoke of his friendship with Gifford. In a 2017 Larry King interview, he said that the show worked because the two "enjoyed each other" and that they were still great friends.

"I just know what Regis was to me. He was, for 15 years, the best partner a person could ever, ever have professionally, but he was my friend."</p><p>She went on to say, "We were dear friends, and after I left the show, for the next 20 years, we became better friends, dearer friends. I saw him two weeks before he died and the minute I found out he had passed, I got in my car and drove to their house."</p><p>She added, "In all the years I knew him, I never saw him unkind to anyone.
