His character, Harris K. Telemacher, with the help of a talking freeway sign, gets into affairs with a journalist. Martin stars alongside Marilu Henner and Sarah Jessica Parker to create this romantic and satirical effort and delivers a fine mix of both comedic and dramatic charms as the leading star.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9.

Father of the Bride&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=803 data-injectable=true>Another one of Martin’s classic comedies, the actor is introduced as an overprotective father who is unable to detach from his daughter and nearly destroys her wedding.
