Jarvis and Bent began discussing what to do with the jug of rubbing alcohol.</span><br></p><p><span>'That's when they're like, "We should pour it on him just to mess with him",' Kenny told police. 'I thought they would pour it on him, kind of soak him, and then run.

And we heard more screaming. It sounded like painful screaming,' Nielsen said.</span><br></p><p><span>The two of them rushed outside and saw Brewer on fire and running. They yelled that he should stop, drop and roll, but he was heading for an apartment complex pool. He jumped the fence and plunged into the water.</span><br></p><p><span>The group of boys scattered in several directions. Jarvis dropped the empty rubbing alcohol jug into a garbage can.<br></span></p><p><span>Brewer tore off his burning shirt, leaving a scorched area in the grass where it landed. The alcohol also ignited a small fire in some bushes. The hair was singed off one of Mendez's arms.</span><br></p><p><span>Nielsen ran over to where Brewer was in the pool, dialing 911 on a neighbor's cell phone. She coaxed Brewer out of the water.

'Somebody poured stuff on him.'</span><br></p><p><span>'Please help me!' Brewer yelled over and over.</span><br></p><p><span>Paramedics arrived and Brewer was airlifted to a Miami hospital. It was far from certain that he would survive.<br></span></p><p><span>Two of the boys went to check on Brewer at the pool, promising him they'd go tell his mother what happened.</span><br></p><p><span>'He had burnt skin everywhere,' Kenny said.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/06/05/article-0-1374D649000005DC-413_634x373.jpg height=373 width=634 alt="Leftover: The burnt clothes belonging to Michael Brewer after he was splashed with a flammable liquid.
