It is raw guitars, Johnny Thunders flying fast and free, with Girl Group harmonies underpinned by David Johansen’s gravel-laden voice. The Dolls were sonically proto rock and roll, with brutal lyrics about teenage angst, not fitting in, subway trains, bad girls, and Frankensteins. This record goes far beyond “Personality Crisis,” the Dolls’ trademark: There isn’t a dull number in the lot, but “Jet Boy” (with fuel-powered riffs from Thunders), “Lonely Planet Boy” (an actual ballad), and their very Dolls-esque version of “Pills” are highlights.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-975d427177c66a087cc7841d00fbc988-7-0-0@published data-word-count=4><b>2.

It opens with a brisk, punchy track called “Critics’ Choice,” where the band takes issue with some of their reviews. The songs you probably know (from locations such as your dentist’s office or a local supermarket) are “Just You and Me,” a love song that was definitely the prom theme for hundreds of high schools across the country that year, and “Feelin’ Stronger Every Day,” a jazzy, inspirational tune with some genuinely interesting time changes that close out the record.

Furnier created the persona of Alice by mixing Bette Davis, Barbarella, and Emma Peel, along with too much makeup and an overall noir-ish vibe. (Stage props included a guillotine, spider webs, and mutilated baby dolls.) All of this comes together on <i>Billion Dollar Babies</i>, the band’s sixth and most successful record, which covers such cheery subjects as serial killers (“Raped and Freezin’”), necrophilia (“I Love the Dead”), and general evil (“No More Mr. Nice Guy”). The songs are backed by a tight band, playing satisfying, straight-ahead rock-and-roll riffs. Producer Bob Ezrin (Lou Reed, KISS, and more) provides a sonic clarity you wouldn’t expect in this kind of music.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-975d427177c66a087cc7841d00fbc988-49-0-0@published data-word-count=7><b>16.

With tracks like “Keep Gettin’ It On,” “Just to Keep You Satisfied,” and the single “You Sure Love to Ball,” Gaye removes all doubt: This record is sex on vinyl, nonstop, all-night-long. It’s also about seduction, and frank desire, and that special kind of midnight longing. Musically, it is smooth and sensual, and you could melt butter off of Gaye’s voice. This was a groundbreaking album (and Gaye’s biggest commercial success), and set the standard for future slow jams to follow.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-975d427177c66a087cc7841d00fbc988-52-0-0@published data-word-count=6><b>17. Steve Miller Band: <i>The Joker</i></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-975d427177c66a087cc7841d00fbc988-54-0-0@published data-word-count=134>Before this album, Steve Miller was a respectable working musician in the San Francisco Bay Area who was well regarded, but wasn’t going to set the world on fire with his brand of psychedelia-fused blues. With <i>The Joker</i>, Miller abandoned any previous formats he may have embraced, and instead began his targeted foray into pop music and million-dollar stardom. This album is engineered for dulcet, pleasing sounds, accomplished both through instruments and as lyrics — whether or not the latter make any sense, or if they involve words that are completely made-up (“the pompatous of love”). The record sounded great on the car radio, the boom box at your barbecue, or the tiny transistor you tucked under your head at the beach, which is the whole key to Miller’s success from this point onward.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-975d427177c66a087cc7841d00fbc988-55-0-0@published data-word-count=6><b>18. Jesus Christ Superstar: Original Soundtrack</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-975d427177c66a087cc7841d00fbc988-57-0-0@published data-word-count=173>The <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> soundtrack was a guilty pleasure for a lot of rock fans in the ‘70s, either because they weren’t religious or they were nice Jewish kids from Long Island. (You’d find the record or the 8-track hiding in the back of people’s music collections.) But it shouldn’t be all that surprising that a story that transformed Jesus into a rock star of sorts, soundtracked by music that was closer to glam, prog rock, and disco than musical theater and played and sung by a cast that included real rock musicians (Ian Gillan from Deep Purple was cast as Jesus) would have appeal that ranged far, far beyond your average matinee crowd. Of course, it was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, who are, y’know, pretty good at writing a catchy melody and good lyrics. “Heaven on Their Minds,” “The Temple,” and “Superstar” are actual rock-and-roll songs — the latter was an honest-to-goodness chart single. (P.S. Go for the stage recording over the movie, any day of the week.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-975d427177c66a087cc7841d00fbc988-58-0-0@published data-word-count=6><b>19.

There is something distant, exotic, and secret implied with Roxy Music’s sound, and they managed to slot themselves in somewhere next to glam rock without seeming at all out of place, but far enough away from mainstream rock to remind us they didn’t belong over there at all. The songs borrow liberally from dozens of different rock-and-roll conventions, but Roxy gave them their own space and texture. Songs like “Do the Strand” and “Editions of You” exemplify Roxy — the combination of vocalist Bryan Ferry’s sleek, cool detachment merged with Brian Eno’s keyboards, Phil Manzanera’s guitar, and the unexpected warmth from Andy Mackay’s saxophone.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-975d427177c66a087cc7841d00fbc988-61-0-0@published data-word-count=7><b>20.

They had big, complex ideas, but they liked loud, heavy sounds to go along with it. <i>Tyranny and Mutation</i> was their second album, a concept piece with two disparate sides — side one is superior, with a strong progression of songs that fit together. Their sophomore release had better clarity and less sludge on the production side, and it’s a surprisingly accessible record full of strong leads, melodies, and almost-hooks, without compromising energy or power. BÖC was a smart band, with lyrics written by founder Sandy Pearlman, along with guests Richard Meltzer (“Teen Archer”) and Patti Smith (“Baby Ice Dog”).</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The World of <i>Vinyl</i>: 20 Albums That Defined 1973</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlob2dgZ3y3tc2yo2ZqYGKura7UpqpmrJiWwW6wxJ%2Bgp52UYn56g5Jnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvinyl-20-albums-that-defined-1973-html.html&text=The%20World%20of%20Vinyl%3a%2020%20Albums%20That%20Defined%201973&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvinyl-20-albums-that-defined-1973-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvinyl-20-albums-that-defined-1973-html.html&title=The%20World%20of%20Vinyl%3a%2020%20Albums%20That%20Defined%201973" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvinyl-20-albums-that-defined-1973-html.html&title=The%20World%20of%20Vinyl%3a%2020%20Albums%20That%20Defined%201973" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvinyl-20-albums-that-defined-1973-html.html&title=The%20World%20of%20Vinyl%3a%2020%20Albums%20That%20Defined%201973" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvinyl-20-albums-that-defined-1973-html.html&description=The%20World%20of%20Vinyl%3a%2020%20Albums%20That%20Defined%201973" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-color-goes-with-black-and-gold.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What color goes with black and gold?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-tragic-real-life-story-of-the-bee-gees.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Tragic Real-Life Story Of The Bee Gees">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
