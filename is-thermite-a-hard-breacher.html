Most players prefer quick roamers and entry operators with strong guns.</p><h3>Is thermite just rust?</h3><p>Thermite is not just rust, but it does contain iron oxide (rust) as one of its ingredients. The reaction of iron oxide and aluminum in thermite produces a high amount of heat, resulting in the production of molten iron metal.</p><h3>Is mute a 2 speed?</h3><p>According to the article, Mute in Rainbow Six Siege is now classified as 3 Speed and 1 Armor operator. This means that he is faster and less armored compared to the previous classification as 2 Speed and 2 Armor operator.</p><h3>Does mute stop thermite?</h3><p>Yes, Mute counters Thermite’s Exothermic Charges. Mute’s signal jammers will completely disable the hard breaching tool and prevent Thermite from successfully breaching reinforced walls or hatches.</p><h3>Can thermite break a gustav gun?</h3><p>No, the story of how a one-man commando used thermite to disable the Gustav Gun in World War II is made-up. In reality, the Gustav Gun was destroyed by the Germans themselves to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Allied troops.</p><h3>Why is thermite good?</h3><p>Thermite is considered a good operator in Rainbow Six Siege because he is an important backline support for attacking teams. His ability to breach reinforced walls and hatches makes him a valuable asset, and his strong primary weapon and access to smoke grenades further enhance his utility and versatility in gameplay.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6iqmasmJq%2FrrXTnmSaZZiWv6V5waucmpuYmr9w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-thermite-a-hard-breacher.html&text=Is%20Thermite%20a%20hard%20breacher%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-thermite-a-hard-breacher.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-thermite-a-hard-breacher.html&title=Is%20Thermite%20a%20hard%20breacher%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-thermite-a-hard-breacher.html&title=Is%20Thermite%20a%20hard%20breacher%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-thermite-a-hard-breacher.html&title=Is%20Thermite%20a%20hard%20breacher%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-thermite-a-hard-breacher.html&description=Is%20Thermite%20a%20hard%20breacher%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./julie-bishop-split-with-david-panton-after-being-together-for-8-years.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julie Bishop Split With David Panton After Being Together For 8 Years">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./choosing-a-gaming-cpu-single-multigpu-at-1440p.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="GPU Benchmarks: Sleeping Dogs - Choosing a Gaming CPU: Single + Multi-GPU at 1440p, April 2013">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
