Today, was just like, very real. Very real and very important to me. It’s like, a huge deal for me to bring someone home even,” he said. “And in this context — like, my dad isn’t doing well. That’s the reality of the situation … ultimately, they were really, I think, surprised to see how much I like you, and how much I wanted you there. Because that’s all they want, too, is for me to be happy, and for me to be with somebody like you.”</p><h3><strong>Meet Erich Schwer Mother, Donna Schwer</strong></h3><p>Erich Schwer’s mother is Donna Schwer. During the hometown episode, he took Gabby to meet his parents. Gabby got the opportunity to speak with Erich’s mother.
