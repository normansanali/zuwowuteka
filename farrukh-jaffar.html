Growing up in a feudal family in Jaunpur, Jaffar inclined towards art and literature at a very early age. Since childhood, she was passionate about watching films, and she was always updated on new releases. After getting married at the age of thirteen, she gave birth to two daughters. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_2><a href=#>[2]</a></span> When Jaffar came to Lucknow from the rural suburbs as a teenage bride, with her charming ways, she became very dear to her in-laws. While in Lucknow, Jaffar graduated from Lucknow University. Although she did what every Indian woman does, like cooking, cleaning, and other household chores, she always had a spark for performing arts, which led her to become one of the most versatile method actresses in India.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family></span><span style=color:purple>Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Farrukh Jaffar belonged to a Muslim family of feudal lords (Zamindars) of Jaunpur. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_3><a href=#>[3]</a></span> She got married to Syed Muhammad Jaffar in 1948. Syed Muhammad Jaffar was an Indian freedom fighter and eminent journalist who later became Congress Party’s Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) in Uttar Pradesh. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_4><a href=#>[4]</a></span> Jaffar is survived by two daughters, Mehru Jaffer, who is a published author and journalist, and Shaheen, who runs a school. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_5><a href=#>[5]</a></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span><span style=color:purple>Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Radio></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Radio></span><strong>Radio</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It was the early ’60s, Jaffar had just graduated from Lucknow University, and by chance, she landed the job of an announcer at All India Radio Lucknow in 1963. Jaffar accompanied one of her friends to the radio station for an audition, and after seeing the recording room, mic, and studio, Jaffar became so fascinated that she asked GM Shaw, a family friend who was the then producer, whether she could also give the audition, and after the audition, she was selected on the spot along with Parveen Talha and one Mr Sinha, and the rest is history. Farrukh Jaffar went on to become the first announcer of Akashvani Lucknow. While talking about it in an interview, she said,</p><p>Don’t know why people address me as the first female radio announcer. I was the first when Vividh Bharti station began in Lucknow. Along with Parveen Talha and one Sinhaji, we were selected in the first lot.” <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_6><a href=#>[6]</a></span></p><p>While working as an announcer at Akashvani Lucknow, she wrote several plays and enacted those roles on air. One of her most popular shows ‘Geeton Bhari Kahani’ was an amalgamation of fiction and Bollywood songs. Jaffar’s other show ‘Panchrangi program’ also became very popular, and Jaffar became a household name with her one-liner –</p><p>“Aap ab suniye all india radio ka panchrangi program akashwani”</p><p>Jaffar worked in Akashvani Lucknow till 1966, and later, she moved to Delhi where her husband had taken up a job as a correspondent with the Chicago Daily News followed by The Washington Post. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_7><a href=#>[7]</a></span> Jaffar’s intense love for drama and film landed her at Vividh Bharti in Delhi, where she met Manzoor Lamin (the station director), who immediately offered a job, and she joined the Vividh Bharti at Delhi’s All India Radio. Soon, she was promoted as a senior most anchor in the Urdu External Services, she worked there till 1970. Due to some family reasons, she quit her job at AIR Delhi and returned to her hometown. In an interview, she talked about this. She said,</p><p>Delhi humko raas nahi aai.

She landed the role by chance when she was emulating Purdil Kaka, a man from Jaffar’s village who used to talk in a ‘dehati’ (rustic) dialect by referring to people with unique names like Karia,’ ‘Bachwa,’ and ‘Banmanus.’ While improvising Purdil Kaka’s accent in her own way at a family gathering, she was spotted by Muzzaffar Ali who instantly offered her a role in his film Umrao Jaan. Initially, she was sceptical about making a career in Bollywood, but her intense love for Bollywood films led her to decide to give acting a shot. In an interview, she uttered her most favourite dialogue from Umrao Jaan –</p><p>जाने क्या ढूँढती रहती है ये आँखें …. मुझ राख के ढेर में न शोले हैं न चिंगारी”</p><p>After her debut in Umrao Jaan, she was offered Swades (2004) 23 years later. In Swades, her role as ‘Panch Fatima Bi’ received critical acclaims.
