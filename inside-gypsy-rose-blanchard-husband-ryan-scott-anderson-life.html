And I had watched her documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, like three years before that," Ryan explained. "And then The Act came out and I've never watched The Act, but I remember my friends talking about The Act and I was like, I'll watch the documentary again. So it was kind of fresh on my mind."</p><p id=e2x-sI-jNoz data-wc=21>When he sent it, he didn't expect to hear back.

I deserve that. He deserves that," she explained. "Our prison wedding was just something to where we can make our vows to each other. It was something that meant something to us. And I think the party is kind of for everybody else and us, but mostly for everybody else."</p><h2 dir=ltr>What has life been like for Gypsy since her release from prison?</h2><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s first video since release from prison<span class=videoPlayerDescription_v1vhbkj6>'I'm finally free'</span></figure><p id=eQF83pOXeMm data-wc=48>Although she's not been out of prison for long, Gypsy has been making the most of her free life as she's reconnected with her father Rod, stepmother Kristy and stepsister Mia.
