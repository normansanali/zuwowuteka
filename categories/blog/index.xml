Better still, with desktops providing room for proper heatsinks (i.e. fins), even passively cooled mini-PCs using laptop-grade silicon are more than viable. The only real drawback to these mini-PCs has largely been the niche nature of the market – leading to high prices and limited choices for higher-performing systems – which is why Topgro has been turning heads as of late with the release of their aggressively priced Intel 12th Gen Core-based K3 Mini PC.</description></item><item><title>VMAs:Video Vanguard Winners Through the Years</title><link>/vmas-video-vanguard-winners-through-the-years.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/vmas-video-vanguard-winners-through-the-years.html</guid><description>MTV has honored Madonna, Britney Spears, Kanye West and more legendary artists with the Video Vanguard Award at the Video Music Awards.

The contrast between the blackness of Jacobean and the warmth of ebony is always spectacular. Dark walnut is a touch lighter compared to Jacobean, yet it serves for the appropriate option in case Jacobean is too dark for you.
