"I haven’t talked to her in seven years. I haven’t talked to her since February of 2010, that’s the last time I had a conversation with her," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine. "I had a conversation with her husband [Kevin Hunter], but it wasn’t nothing productive —&nbsp;just a bunch of yelling and screaming."</p><p>So, what happened between Charlamagne and Wendy (and Kevin)?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Charlamagne and Wendy Williams beef explained:&nbsp;</h2><p>In his best-selling book Black Privilege, Charlamagne claimed he was fired from Wendy's radio show in 2008, but it wasn't due to downsizing, as was initially claimed.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He accused Kevin of letting him go because of a bad business deal.</p><p>"He was always extremely aggressive in trying to get more money out of situations,” he wrote, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BET</a>. "He’d yell at and often threaten people till he got what he wanted. I can’t lie: It’s worked for him and Wendy. But it wasn’t how I wanted to do business."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He told People that, while he knows why his relationship with Kevin soured, he has no idea why Wendy turned on him.</p><p>"I know why me and her husband fell out, but I don’t know what he said to her,” he explained. "I don’t know what her perception is of why her husband says, ‘We don’t mess with him no mo.'"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">While the beef between Charlamagne and Wendy seems to have been squashed, it isn't over for her ex, Kevin Hunter.</h2><p>It all started with recent comments about Kwame Brown that Charlamagne made while commenting on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tiff between Brown and Matt Barnes</a>, which also involves popular sports personality Stephen Smith. Charlamagne made references to Brown's family's history of murder and domestic abuse. Brown didn't appreciate the allusions the radio personality made and had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">few choice words for the host</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Hunter seems to have piggybacked on the ire hurled towards Charlamagne, writing on Instagram, "I see we back to Charlamagne storytelling time!" (Salute to Kwame Brown) After all the talk I think it's time to share some real scary truths about an individual y'all really still [know] nothing about. And definitely time to clear up the lies. Truth is powerful, and there is only one true God. I regret the day I ever brought you around any of my people."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He continued, "My ex been told me you was a piece of s--t, and I mean early. I was like, 'Nah this lil dude like my brother.' Treated him like family, [opened] my home, let [him] live rent-free, got [him] his first job and salary next to the queen of New York radio in the No. 1. market only for this f--kboy to act like an unappreciative piece of s--t. Time for TRUTH."</p><p>Charlamagne hasn't responded to Kevin's IG call out, however, he has recently apologized to Kwame Brown.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Charlamagne had a lot to say about Kevin Hunter, however, in his response to Wendy Williams' divorce.&nbsp;</h2><p>Following the announcement that Wendy was divorcing her husband of more than 20 years, Charlamagne did what he does best and named Kevin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Donkey of the Day."</a></p><p>"If you want to know why I don't rock with Kelvin Hunter, I have told you all that we had stopped communicating in February of 2010 because he got upset because he thought I was trying to <a href=#>hook his mistress [Sharina Hudson] up</a> with my friend Wax," he said on The Breakfast Club, referring to Kevin by his "government" name.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Now, the reason I have no smoke for Wendy is, number one, I feel sorry for her because she was an abused woman on various levels and two, I know Kelvin didn't go to Wendy and say, 'Yeah we don't rock with Charlamagne anymore because he tried to hook my side chick up with his homeboy.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He went on to accuse Kevin of trying to sabotage his career over the past nine years, and even threatening his co-hosts Angela Yee and DJ Envy for working with him.</p><p>"Kev, you deserve everything that is happening to you right now because you do understand that everything you attempt to do to someone has already been done to you," Charlamagne continued.

And Charlamagne confirmed that he did reach out to his former boss.</p><p>"It’s not a date at all,” he said on his morning show. "For me, [as] someone who used to be friends with Wendy, work with Wendy, and having a front-row seat to a lot of the abuse I saw her endure, I’m just happy that she’s finally free of that stuff."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>He added, "I wish her the best.
