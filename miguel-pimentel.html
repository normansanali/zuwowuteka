Not satisfied with the single, its video, and his treatment overall, he parted ways with the label.</p><p>Since then, he has stated that this experience taught him to take control of how he was marketed, rather than relying on the label to differentiate him from the crowd of male R&B vocalists.</p><p>In the year 2007, he signed a new recording contract with ‘Jive Records’.</p><p>Likewise, his next album ‘All I Want Is You’ was not released for several years pending a lawsuit brought by Black Ice for breach of contract.
