In this mission, you’ll need to make some tough decisions which will change the rest of your playthrough going forward.</p><p id=pPD5cM>In this Starfield guide, we’ll walk you through the “High Price to Pay” mission and let you know what will happen before you make your decisions.</p><h2 id=tqjdkA><strong>Should you go to The Eye or stay in the Lodge?</strong></h2><p id=V6NCs5>The moment you get back from the “<a href=#><strong>No Sudden Moves</strong></a>” mission, you’ll be able to place your artifact in the <strong>Armillary </strong>like usual, but something will clearly be wrong in the <strong>Lodge</strong>. It’s time to make a tough choice.</p><h3 id=fozahV><strong>Talk to Noel</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwnAVqg49mzvya8ClGAmFmBIOPk=/0x0:1920x1080/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24883463/vlcsnap_2023_08_29_22h57m37s202.png"><p id=dbzRm5>When you place the artifact, you’ll notice that the entire <strong>Constellation </strong>crew is gathered around the digital table in the back of the library. They’re all talking to <strong>Vladimir</strong>, who is up in <strong>The Eye</strong> and describing an attack that they just endured. He sounds injured, and if you pry, he’ll tell you that another of your companions is injured.</p><p id=gdvPRm>Vladimir will also tell you that the mysterious being who attacked The Eye is coming for the Lodge and all your artifacts.</p><h2 id=dlaMQq><strong>Go to the Eye // Stay in the Lodge</strong></h2><p id=mBP3Cz>[<strong>Warning:</strong> This section contains a <strong>major spoiler</strong> for this mission and the outcome of your choice.]</p><p id=VOQIAQ>When you get off the call with Vladimir, you’ll only have a few seconds to make your choice. You can either:</p><ul><li id=AP8m8s><strong>Leave the Lodge</strong> and go to The Eye</li><li id=vo0ceR><strong>Stay in the Lodge</strong> and protect the artifacts</li></ul><h3 id=UWxf6g><strong>Can you save everyone in ‘High Price to Pay’?</strong></h3><p id=NpUvrM>Your choice here has a major consequence, and is the biggest in the entirety of Starfield’s main quest. No matter what option you choose, <strong>one of your companions will die</strong>, and there’s <strong>nothing you can do to save them both</strong>.</p><p id=PiOaFi>As for who will live and who will die, it seems like your <strong>two most-used companions</strong> are in danger. For me, that was <strong>Sam Coe</strong> and <strong>Barrett</strong>. For other Polygon folks it was <strong>Sarah </strong>or <strong>Andreja</strong>. How much time you spend with them seems to dictate where they are at a given time, but our data suggests that if you want to save your most-used companion you need to go wherever they are. In our testing, Andreja was in The Eye in one playthrough and the Lodge in another, for example.</p><p id=QdSPfd>This decision is entirely up to you. The death of your companion will have major narrative implications, but it won’t change how any upcoming missions actually play out. So pick your favorite character and go rescue you them knowing you’re leaving another one to die.</p><p id=fYlnCW>Determine where you want to go and either hang out in the Lodge (head up to the <strong>bar </strong>if you want to get a jump on the assailant) or walk back to your ship and fly to The Eye.</p><p id=QyvE51>If you need help on the moment to moment gameplay of the next section, move to whichever variant section you picked.</p><h2 id=v3IDKj><strong>Choice 1: Go to The Eye</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bU6Ong3PRHmMP2Kal6ANEMDqXjY=/0x0:1920x1080/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24883474/vlcsnap_2023_08_29_23h00m33s707.png"><p id=TEmSEz>If you choose to go to The Eye, one of your companions will try and stop you at the door.

She’ll be doubled over and will almost attack you when you talk to her. Have a quick chat and prepare yourself for battle. <strong>The Hunter</strong> will interrupt your chat. Either hold him off or shoot him until he disappears.</p><p id=VTGikQ>Be warned that he’s very tough and can kill you quickly if you’re not careful. But he is worth spending ammo on, as he’ll give you a pretty <strong>cool gun </strong>later if you manage to defeat him, the <strong>Unrestrained Vengeance</strong> laser rifle.</p><h3 id=7STZ9T><strong>Escape to your ship // Initiate take-off // Go to The Eye</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DkWtt216wO3N4qfD-qKKiwz2L_g=/0x0:1920x1080/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24883478/vlcsnap_2023_08_29_23h01m13s973.png"><p id=AVxntK>Once you do battle with The Hunter, follow Noel through<strong> The Well</strong> district and back to your ship.

Wait for the individual to push Walter over and then start blasting.</p><p id=P76rZ8>Your job here is to hold off “<strong>The Hunter</strong>,” the name of the <strong>Starborn </strong>who is attacking you and your friends. You need to “hold him off” which basically means don’t die. But he’s worth spending some ammo on either way, as he’ll give you a cool gun — the <strong>Unrestrained Vengeance</strong> laser rifle — if you manage to deal enough damage to him.</p><p id=kg2PNU>Just be careful as The Hunter and his <strong>duplicate </strong>(also just called The Hunter) are extremely tough.
