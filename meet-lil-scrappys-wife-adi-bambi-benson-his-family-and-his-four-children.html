Richardson was discovered by producer and musician Lil Jon while performing at a bar in Atlanta.</strong></p><p>Lil Scrappy was one of the first musicians signed to Lil Jon’s BME Recordings, along with labelmates Trillville.</p><p>His debut album, The King of Crunk & BME Recordings Present: Trillville & Lil Scrappy, was released in 2004 as a split. The album peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard 200.</p><p>The rumor of Ice Cube’s divorce is untrue; he is still happily married to Kimberly Woodruff and has children with her.</p><p>Prince of the South 2, his second independent album, was made available through Real Talk Entertainment on October 19, 2010. He has been in all seven seasons of Love & Hip Hop Atlanta since 2012.</p><h2><span id=What_Will_Lil_Scrappy8217s_Net_Worth_Be_in_2023>What Will Lil Scrappy’s Net Worth Be in 2023?</span></h2><p>Lil Scrappy’s net worth is a little under $1 million, or around $100,000, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>If you release enough songs that people like being a hip-hop star may go far around the globe. Financial success may result from becoming a reality TV star.</p><p>After working for record labels including BME Records, Reprise Records, and G-Unit Records, he currently earns $900,000.</p><p>Over the years, he has worked closely and produced a lot of songs with a wide range of musicians, including Missy Elliot and DMX.

Meet Adi “Bambi” Benson, His Wife</span></h2><p>Yes, Little Scrappy’s wife is a mother of four kids. On June 25, 2022, they welcomed their fourth child, becoming new parents. The couple also has a daughter named Xylo and a boy named Breland.</p><p>The mother was wearing a similar outfit and was holding a newborn daughter who was wrapped in a leopard-print cloth. It was nothing short of devastating to watch Bambi, who was lying on the hospital bed, look lovingly at her adorable child.</p><p>She is a well-known American actress and model who hails from the state of California. Adi has acted in movies including “Beauty & the Beholder.” She is an actress as well as having acted in “Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta.”</p><p>After being wed for more than four years, Scrappy and Bambi want the world to know that everything at Club O is OK. The two first connected at a party where they later grew close and had a romantic relationship.</p><p>Adi Bambi Benson wed Lil Scrappy in 2017, and the couple had a kid they named Breland the following year.</p><p>On social media, the actress routinely shares pictures of her and her child. Lil Scrappy was divorced before Adi’s union with the rapper, and he had a kid called Emani from a prior union.</p><h2><span id=Meet_His_Mother_Lil_Scrappy_Family_Ethnicity_Examined>Meet His Mother, Lil Scrappy Family Ethnicity Examined</span></h2><p>Lil Scrappy, real name Darryl Kevin Richardson, was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 19, 1984. He is of African descent.</p><p>The family was abandoned by Darryl Sr. before Lil Scrappy was even born. Then, Scrappy’s single mother reared him and his brothers. He went to a military high school in California.</p><p>Due to a quarrel between the Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta star and his wife, Bambi Richardson, Momma Dee, the mother of Scrappy, has said she no longer speaks to her son.</p><p>Dee allegedly claimed that her ongoing argument with Richardson was the root of her strained relationship with her child, according to Bossip.</p><p>She wed Ernest Bryant in 1996; however, they separated in 2014. The pair were wedded in 2015, and the fourth-season finale of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta showcased their nuptials. The rapper is related to Darryl Richardson Jr. and Jasmine Brown.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Aeko Catori Brown, Jordana Lajoie, and Cogeian Sky Embry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":67}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aeko-catori-brown/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jordana-lajoie/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cogeian-sky-embry/"}{"1":67}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Rapper</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Tessa Wong From the Capture?
