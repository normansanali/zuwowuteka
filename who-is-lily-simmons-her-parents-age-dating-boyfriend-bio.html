her modeling debut, has seen her career progress considerably since her screen debut.&nbsp;The actress is also known for being fun, dynamic, beautiful, and down-to-earth.&nbsp;Here is more information about it.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Lily Simmons?&nbsp;Bio & Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lili Marie Simmons was born in a seaside community;Cardiff by the sea, Encinitas, on July 23, 1993, on the edge of Solana Beach, south in San Diego County, California.&nbsp;The young actress was discovered at the age of 15 by her talented chef, Kale Linden.</span></p><p><span>Since then, she has built a very successful career as both a model and an actress.&nbsp;Beyond that, much of Lili’s personal and early life is kept under wraps and shielded from the media.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family: his parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lili was born to Thomas Curtis and Eve Simmons.&nbsp;Her family is of mixed ancestry with her mother being part Swedish, Danish, Dutch and Norwegian.&nbsp;Also, there is not much information online about Lili’s parents and her family.</span></p><p><span>It is also unknown if Lili has any siblings or is an only child – although it is generally assumed that she is, as no siblings have been seen on her social media pages.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Career</span></strong></h3><p><span>Before her acting career, Lili Simmons was firsta model.&nbsp;During her years as a model, she worked for Ford, Bebe and Roxy stores.&nbsp;She has also made appearances in commercials and print ads for companies like Saturn.</span></p><p><span>Lili started full acting in 2010 where she featured in the web series –&nbsp;</span><span>Hollywood is like high school,</span><span>&nbsp;playing the role of Quinn Whitaker.&nbsp;She also appeared in the 2011 Disney Channel Original Movie&nbsp;</span><span>Geek Charming</span><span>.&nbsp;She believed the film would be enjoyed by more teenage girls who tend to be much more concerned with popularity in school and how they will handle it.</span></p><p><span>She then made a guest appearance on an episode of the sitcom&nbsp;</span><span>Mr. Sunshine,</span><span>&nbsp;which starred Matthew Perry in his lead role.</span></p><p><span>Lili Simmons in 2012 starred in the movie&nbsp;</span><span>Fat Kid Rule the World</span><span>&nbsp;which was directed by Matthew Lillard.&nbsp;Also in 2012, she appeared in an episode of&nbsp;</span><span>Jane by Design.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, she started playing the role of “Rebecca Bowman”, a rebellious Amish in the Cinemax series.&nbsp;</span><span>Banshee</span><span>.&nbsp;She was surprised when she got the part because she didn’t audition for Rebecca but for another character – Deva Hopewell.&nbsp;Her role in&nbsp;</span><span>Banshee</span><span>&nbsp;definitely puts her on the map.&nbsp;</span><span>Banshee</span><span>&nbsp;seems to be the first thing that comes to mind when Lili Simmons is mentioned.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, she began playing intermittent roles in&nbsp;</span><span>Hawaii-Five O</span><span>&nbsp;and the HBO series&nbsp;</span><span>True Detective.&nbsp;</span><span>Two years later, in 2016, she appeared in another critically acclaimed HBO series.&nbsp;</span><span>WestWorld.</span></p><p><span>And in 2017, she was cast in Showtime’s git drama series&nbsp;</span><span>Ray Donovan,</span><span>&nbsp;playing the role of Natalie James.&nbsp;She also appeared in other movies like&nbsp;</span><span>Bone Tomahawk</span><span>&nbsp;(2015),&nbsp;</span><span>Dirty Lies</span><span>&nbsp;(2016),&nbsp;</span><span>Two Face</span><span>&nbsp;(2017) and&nbsp;</span><span>Bad Game</span><span>&nbsp;(2017)&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life, dating and boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>The actress would be in a relationship with Tom Pelphrey.&nbsp;The actor, who happened to be a Daytime Emmy Award winning actor, has always treated Lili Simmons with admiration.</span></p><p><span>The two flaunted their relationship on social media like most couples these days tend to do.&nbsp;Lili posted a photo from the birthday party Tom threw for her.&nbsp;Tom also posted a photo saying how happy he was to be with Lili Simmons.&nbsp;But as of now, such posts have diminished and are no longer seen.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Height, weight and body measurements</span></strong></h3><p><span>Lili Simmons is an ardent and ardent believer in eating well and living well.&nbsp;She is the one who cannot do without training and a balanced diet.</span></p><p><span>Therefor, the model-turned-actress is 5ft 7in tall and weighs 54kg.&nbsp;Her waist is 33-24-35 inches, her bra size is 32A, her dress size is size 2 (US), and her shoe size is 8/39 (EU).</span></p><p><span>She recommends that medication and constant exercise helps keep not only the body fit, but the mind as well.&nbsp;Well-being is an integral part of his life philosophy.&nbsp;To satisfy her curiosity for healthy eating, she once tried the “raw food diet”.&nbsp;As expected, the experience was not pleasant.</span></p><p><span>The 24-year-old also has a habit of taking green tea, in addition to adding ‘greens’ (leafy vegetables) to his smoothies.&nbsp;Her love for physical exercise cannot be extinguished even with the distance from her gymnasium.&nbsp;It’s either she finds a new gym, especially in a hotel, or she calls her trainer to give her a little workout.&nbsp;She literally can’t go a full day without it.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lili Simmons, with her steady progress in the industry, was able to build up a net worth of $2 million.&nbsp;As it continues to grow, it will likely exceed current net worth.&nbsp;Granted, that’s an impressive sum for someone so young in the industry, but Lili has proven she’s got what it takes and deserves every penny.</span></p><p class=postsid
