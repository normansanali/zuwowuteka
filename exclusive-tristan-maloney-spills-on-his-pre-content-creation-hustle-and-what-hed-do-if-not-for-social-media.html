I'm used to just me, my phone, and my creative process."</p><p>However, he's adamant that those jitters are just par for the course.</p><p>"Better to say, 'I tried,' than always think, 'What if?'"</p><h2 id=tristan-reveals-where-he-finds-inspiration>Tristan Reveals Where He Finds Inspiration</h2><p>We're certainly hoping to see Tristan on bigger screens soon, but in the meantime, the content he creates will certainly suffice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On that, we asked if he could conclude our chat by naming where he finds his inspiration.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given how he's previously told TheThings about his family's supportiveness, the first place he points is his loved ones.</p><p>"Hanging out with my family and friends gives me so many ideas for skits. No matter what we're doing, there's always something funny."</p><p>On top of them, he adds that a number of comedians and actors serve as his inspiration, on a regular basis.</p><p>"I could give a horrendously long list, but just to give an idea, Jim Carrey, Jack Black, Adam Sandler, Robin Williams, Chevy Chase, Vince Vaughn, Ryan Reynolds ... yeah, too many!"</p><p>Well, wherever he's getting his inspo, it's working!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmq6uho6mur3nMmqOoppWuerS8yKWjrGWfo3qptdJmp6udXZi8r8DEp6tmm6KarrW1zqdkoa2jqbmmecCnm2avmJbBbrTEnWSdp12es266zq1kn6eiYsCwr8iao2allZm2ons%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-tristan-maloney-spills-on-his-pre-content-creation-hustle-and-what-hed-do-if-not-for-social-media.html&text=Tristan%20Maloney%20Spills%20On%20His%20Pre-Content%20Creation%20Hustle%2c%20And%20What%20He%27d%20Do%20If%20Not%20For%20Social%20Media&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-tristan-maloney-spills-on-his-pre-content-creation-hustle-and-what-hed-do-if-not-for-social-media.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-tristan-maloney-spills-on-his-pre-content-creation-hustle-and-what-hed-do-if-not-for-social-media.html&title=Tristan%20Maloney%20Spills%20On%20His%20Pre-Content%20Creation%20Hustle%2c%20And%20What%20He%27d%20Do%20If%20Not%20For%20Social%20Media" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fexclusive-tristan-maloney-spills-on-his-pre-content-creation-hustle-and-what-hed-do-if-not-for-social-media.html&title=Tristan%20Maloney%20Spills%20On%20His%20Pre-Content%20Creation%20Hustle%2c%20And%20What%20He%27d%20Do%20If%20Not%20For%20Social%20Media" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-tristan-maloney-spills-on-his-pre-content-creation-hustle-and-what-hed-do-if-not-for-social-media.html&title=Tristan%20Maloney%20Spills%20On%20His%20Pre-Content%20Creation%20Hustle%2c%20And%20What%20He%27d%20Do%20If%20Not%20For%20Social%20Media" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-tristan-maloney-spills-on-his-pre-content-creation-hustle-and-what-hed-do-if-not-for-social-media.html&description=Tristan%20Maloney%20Spills%20On%20His%20Pre-Content%20Creation%20Hustle%2c%20And%20What%20He%27d%20Do%20If%20Not%20For%20Social%20Media" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./whats-new-on-netflix-november-2015-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whats New on Netflix: November 2015">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sarah-jessica-parker-on-why-carrie-didnt-call-911-during-and-just-like-that-first-episode-kidspot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Jessica Parker on why Carrie didn't call 911 during And Just Like That first episode -Kidspot">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
