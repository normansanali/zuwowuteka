the club put him into their U-8 category.</p><p>He was quick to make his skills and ability to move quickly on the ball made him one of the best under his age category as he continues to progress.</p><p>Birmingham City had to place him in their Under 18 team at 14 years old due to his ability to play amid more senior footballers than he was.</p><p>Playing with older people helped him a lot as he could adapt quickly while his footwork and agility were double folds for a 14-year-old.</p><p>On 15 October 2018, Jude Bellingham made his appearance for Birmingham City Under 23 during their match against Nottingham Forest.</p><p>In the match against Forest, he scored the only goal in the 87th minute, which gifted them a win.</p><p>His progress continued with Jude scoring three times from ten appearances for the Under 23 side back in March 2019.</p><p>Soon after, he started gaining buzz all across Europe while his team had to gradually introduce him to their first team, still a schoolboy learning.</p><p>He was also quick to adapt to training with senior players;
