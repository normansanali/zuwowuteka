Thanks to modern technology, there are many, many options out there, even for those with limited budgets, schedules and mobility — ranging in price from absolutely free to thousands of dollars.</p><p>In addition to the traditional route of consulting books or signing up for an in-person class through a synagogue, Jewish community center or university — or traveling to Israel where there are myriad in-person courses and programs — you now can choose from an array of online courses, apps and software. Or, you can set aside a summer vacation for a full-scale immersion program in rustic Vermont!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selecting the Right Program for You</h2><p>In sifting among the options, think about your goals, your level of self-discipline and how much time you are able to commit to the endeavor. Are you looking simply to decode so you can follow along in the <a href=#>prayer book</a>? Do you want to study the Bible in its original? Seeking to learn a few phrases to use on a vacation in Israel? Or are you hoping to become fluent in conversational Hebrew?</p><p>Vardit Ringvald, director of the School of Hebrew at Middlebury College and a longtime consultant to a variety of institutions that teach Hebrew, also suggests you think about your learning style. “Some people are very independent” and can teach themselves from a book or self-paced program, but others need the social interaction and structure of studying with other&nbsp;people at a scheduled time.</p><p>While apps can be engaging and are useful for introducing and reinforcing vocabulary, Ringvald says, they lack “real interaction,” which can make it hard for students to progress from intermediate to advanced or “be able to use the language in real-life situations.”</p><p>Although many beginners are interested in focusing on reading or biblical/prayer book Hebrew exclusively, Ringvald encourages learners to jump in with conversational Hebrew.</p><p>“Modern Hebrew will reinforce your classical Hebrew,” she says. “It’s not a linear process where first you learn the alphabet, second you learn to read and third you learn the language. Doing it all together is key to success.”</p><p>Below is a sampling of online courses and resources organized by category and alphabetically. Did we miss something important?
