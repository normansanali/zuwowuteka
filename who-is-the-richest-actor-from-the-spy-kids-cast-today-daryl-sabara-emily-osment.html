The creator's spy comedy Spy Kids quickly became a huge success upon its release as it became and still continues to be a household favorite for families worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What 'Spy Kids' Star Carmen Cortez Looks Like Now, And Who She's Married To</a></span></p><p>The film, which would later become the first of a quadrilogy, followed the story of two young kids, Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) and <a href=#>Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara)</a>, children of the alluring couple Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid Cortez (Cara Gugino). Whilst the four may have superficially seemed like a regular nuclear family, the reality was far more exciting than their facade would have had you thinking— they were all spies! The film’s success proved immeasurable for the actors whose careers it kickstarted, but just how far did the film franchise take them and who holds the number one spot for richest today?</p><h2 id=daryl-sabara><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Daryl Sabara</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daryl Sabara portrayed the young, fun-loving Juni Cortez in the franchise. His character often found himself overshadowed by his sister, yet in critical moments he would pull through and prove his spy abilities. By the time the third film of the franchise, Spy Kids: Game Over, was released, Sabara’s character had developed into a fine young spy and even led the feature. Since Spy Kids, Sabara has undertaken some roles in both film and television. Most recently Sabara became a father when his wife Meghan Trainor gave birth to their baby boy Riley Sabara in February 2021. Celebrity Net Worth reports his net worth to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">come in at $750 thousand.</a></p><h2 id=emily-osment><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Emily Osment</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her role as the Cortez siblings’ biggest rival, Gerty Giggles, Emily Osment went on to have a pretty successful career. She continued her career in children’s entertainment when she got the role of Lilly Truscott in the hit Disney Channel series, Hannah Montana, in 2006. The show lasted 5 years on air with the final episode airing in 2011. Since then, the actress has also developed a singing career. Osment's net worth reportedly comes in at $3 million.</p><h2 id=alan-cumming><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Alan Cumming</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scottish actor Alan Cumming portrayed the role of Fegan Floop, a quirky showrunner with a passion for cloning and bizarre experiments. Outside of the Spy Kids series, Cumming continues to develop a successful creative career showcasing not only his acting skills but also those as a singer and writer. With an impressive array of accolades under his belt such as an Independent Spirit Award and even a couple of Olivier Awards, it’s no doubt that the talented actor possesses a special finesse towards his craft. However with Celebrity Net Worth reporting his net worth at $5 million, Cumming only takes the sixth spot on this list.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Spy Kids' Meets 'Sharkboy And Lavagirl' In 'We Are Heroes', Netflix's Next Movie</a></span></p><h2 id=alexa-penavega><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alexa PenaVega</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Known for her role as the critical thinking, level-headed Carmen Cortez, <a href=#>Alexa PenaVega was thrust into the limelight</a> following the success of Sky Kids. Since then the actress has undertaken several roles in both film and television. PenaVega also ventured into the world of singing as she began to release singles to accompany her acting roles. Her current net worth stands at $8 million.</p><h2 id=danny-trejo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Danny Trejo</span></h2><p>Moving onto rough and ready Danny Trejo, the rugged mechanic known as Machete in the Spy Kids series. Prior to his role in Spy Kids, Trejo had lived a long complicated life of crime, incarceration, and redemption. His roller-coaster journey of a career saw him become the staple Hollywood tough guy. Trejo’s net worth comes in at $8 million, making him neck and neck with his co-star PenaVega on the list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steve-buscemi><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Steve Buscemi</span></h2><p>Coming in at number three on the list is the talented Steve Buscemi. Buscemi portrayed the anxious Romero— a mad scientist who lives in a constant state of terror of the animal hybrids he created— in the second installment of the film series, Spy Kids: Island Of Lost Dreams. He also made a brief appearance in the third film, Spy Kids: Game Over. Outside the Spy Kids series, Buscemi has worked alongside some of Hollywood’s finest talents such as Quentin Tarantino and Adam Sandler. In 1993 Buscemi portrayed the role of Mr. Pink in Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs. Buscemi ranks third due to his $35 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=antonio-banderas><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Antonio Banderas</span></h2><p>Perhaps one of the most recognizable faces in the entire Spy Kids franchise, it’s no secret that Antonio Banderas had been and continues to be an established and successful actor outside of the children’s series. He is most recognized for his roles in the legendary director Pedro Almodovar’s films. Coming in with a whopping $50 million net worth, this Hollywood legend ranks second on the list.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Carla Gugino Has Been In Since 'Spy Kids'</a></span></p><h2 id=george-clooney><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>George Clooney</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And finally coming in at number one on this list of talented actors and actresses is Hollywood’s "it man" himself, George Clooney. It is only to be expected that the Hollywood powerhouse is at the top of his league with several Academy Awards and countless other honors. His net worth seems to reflect this, as Clooney comes in at a tremendous $500 million! Perhaps best reflected by his lavish lifestyle, it is no surprise that Clooney is crowned first at the very top of this list of actors and actresses. For example, this can be seen in the actor and his wife, Amal Clooney’s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">current property portfolio.</a> Although Clooney only portrayed a small role in the Spy Kids franchise, the net worth he has accumulated over the span of his successful career is incomparable to that of his co-stars.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The 'Spy Kids' Reunion Just Happened And Meghan Trainor Joined In All The Fun</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZKuhk52ytMCMmpqtp6Jis7O7zGaroZ1dqL26ecqim6xlk5bAtXnTqJuasV2ZrrPFy2aqmpqRp65uscyio7Jln6i6prrTaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-actor-from-the-spy-kids-cast-today-daryl-sabara-emily-osment.html&text=Who%20Is%20The%20Richest%20Actor%20From%20The%20%27Spy%20Kids%27%20Cast%20Today%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-richest-actor-from-the-spy-kids-cast-today-daryl-sabara-emily-osment.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-actor-from-the-spy-kids-cast-today-daryl-sabara-emily-osment.html&title=Who%20Is%20The%20Richest%20Actor%20From%20The%20%27Spy%20Kids%27%20Cast%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-actor-from-the-spy-kids-cast-today-daryl-sabara-emily-osment.html&title=Who%20Is%20The%20Richest%20Actor%20From%20The%20%27Spy%20Kids%27%20Cast%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-actor-from-the-spy-kids-cast-today-daryl-sabara-emily-osment.html&title=Who%20Is%20The%20Richest%20Actor%20From%20The%20%27Spy%20Kids%27%20Cast%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-actor-from-the-spy-kids-cast-today-daryl-sabara-emily-osment.html&description=Who%20Is%20The%20Richest%20Actor%20From%20The%20%27Spy%20Kids%27%20Cast%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kim-serafin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="American TV actress and author, Kim Serafin's Marital Life with Husband, Marc Shulga &amp;amp; Their Childre">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-paul-molitor-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Paul Molitor Dating Now?
