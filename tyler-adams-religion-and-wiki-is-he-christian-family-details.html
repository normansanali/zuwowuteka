The American soccer star was raised in New York by a single mother before joining a huge family. The Bournemouth player has always spoken about how important his stepfather, Darryl, has been in his life. Tyler joined the Scottish clan that loved Rangers with every ounce of their blood once his mother married Darryl.</p><p>His soccer-crazed family fueled his passion for the game and shaped him into the player he is today. In last year’s World Cup, the child captained his team, becoming the competition’s youngest captain, and he also guided his team to the knockout rounds.&nbsp;The USMNT captain is now out due to a recurrence of a hamstring issue. Adams is scheduled to return in late February or early March. Bournemouth bought the midfielder from Leeds United on a free transfer earlier this year.</p><h2>Is Tyler Adams Christian? Religion</h2><p><strong>Tyler Adams</strong> has not said whether or if he is a Christian. The soccer star has kept his personal life out of the public eye and has not spoken openly about his beliefs.&nbsp;Unlike many other sportsmen, Adams has not indicated his religious affiliation on social media. However, the midfielder was seen spending Christmas with his family.&nbsp;Tyler was seen standing in front of a Christmas tree in 2020. He wished his fans a Merry Christmas and said that he would be giving away his autographed shirt. Tyler was born and raised in New York, so he was exposed to a variety of cultures. Tyler’s real father was never present in his life since he was raised by a single mother, Melissa Russo.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tyler-Adams-1.jpg alt="Tyler Adams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The mother-son team resided in Poughkeepsie, New York, in a modest two-bedroom apartment right below their uncle’s. Melissa, a kind mother, was an important figure in her son’s life.&nbsp;Tyler said that witnessing his mother work hard as a child encouraged him. Melissa returned to university when Tyler entered second grade, and the two would visit the library after Melissa returned home from her full-time work so she could focus on her studies.</p><p>Darryl Sullivan, Tyler’s stepfather, joined his and Melissa’s lives while Tyler was in seventh grade. Darryl, a teammate who has now become his brother, introduced him. Tyler said in an interview that his stepfather’s family is from Scotland and are Rangers supporters.&nbsp;Tyler said that Darryl’s presence in his life caused him to become infatuated with soccer, which was ideal for him. Adams noted that his father was always there for him and instilled much-needed confidence in him.</p><h2>Tyler Adams’ Brother: Darryl Jr., Dylan, and Donovan Sullivan Adams</h2><p>The AFC Bournemouth player has three stepbrothers but no biological brothers. Tyler played soccer with the eldest of the three, Darryl Jr.&nbsp;Darryl contacted Tyler after school once and commended his abilities. Following that, the two witnessed their parents become closer, and they now have a lifetime bond.&nbsp;Darryl Jr, unlike his brother, pursued football and abandoned soccer. He graduated in 2021 after playing offensive line at Marist College. He then attended Robert Morris University and is now employed as an Account Representative for Total Quality Logistics.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tyler-Adams-2.jpg alt="Tyler Adams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Dylan, Tyler’s second stepbrother, has followed in his footsteps and plays soccer with the New York Red Bulls II. He graduated from Clemson University last year after playing 38 games and scoring three goals there.&nbsp;Dylan is on Instagram as @dsully_6 and has published a few posts, most of which are on his soccer career. Donovan, the youngest of the siblings, is a student at UNCW and remains a strong supporter of his brothers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirsqSVp3qisMCmqmaqlaG2qLXOp2SappRixKq3yGagrGWYmnqktNGiqq2hkaN6p63MoqOyZZSawaK1y6xm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftyler-adams-religion-and-wiki-is-he-christian-family-details.html&text=Tyler%20Adams%20Religion%20And%20Wiki%3a%20Is%20He%20Christian%3f%20Family%20Details&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftyler-adams-religion-and-wiki-is-he-christian-family-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftyler-adams-religion-and-wiki-is-he-christian-family-details.html&title=Tyler%20Adams%20Religion%20And%20Wiki%3a%20Is%20He%20Christian%3f%20Family%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftyler-adams-religion-and-wiki-is-he-christian-family-details.html&title=Tyler%20Adams%20Religion%20And%20Wiki%3a%20Is%20He%20Christian%3f%20Family%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftyler-adams-religion-and-wiki-is-he-christian-family-details.html&title=Tyler%20Adams%20Religion%20And%20Wiki%3a%20Is%20He%20Christian%3f%20Family%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftyler-adams-religion-and-wiki-is-he-christian-family-details.html&description=Tyler%20Adams%20Religion%20And%20Wiki%3a%20Is%20He%20Christian%3f%20Family%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-scent-used-in-hotel-lobbies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the scent used in hotel lobbies?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./trey-kennedy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trey Kennedy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
