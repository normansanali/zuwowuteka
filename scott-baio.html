I wasnt interested in that ever and I always had this thing in me, for some reason, that if God was kind enough to give me a healthy body and mind, I was not going to screw it up.&nbsp;<strong>– Scott Baio</strong></p><p>I love driving cars, looking at them, cleaning and washing and shining them. Im very touchy about cars. I dont want anybody leaning on them or closing the door too hard, know what I mean?&nbsp;<strong>– Scott Baio</strong></p><p>I dont have an iPod. I dont get the whole iPod thing. Who has time to listen to that much music? If I had one, it would probably have Sinatra, Beatles, some 70s music, some 80s music, and thats it.&nbsp;<strong>– Scott Baio</strong></p><p>One thing I wont be doing on a weekend is shopping.

Its much easier.&nbsp;<strong>– Scott Baio</strong></p><h2>3 Lessons for Life from Scott Baio</h2><p>After learning everything there is to know about Scott Baio’s net worth and his path to success, let’s look at some of the things we can all learn from him.</p><h3>1. pessimism</h3><p>Positive thinking involves perceiving the glass as half empty rather than half full.
