The talented and charismatic Rath has featured in several movies and TV shows in the course of his relatively young career. One of them is the American sci-fi series, Defiance. The series focuses on post-apocalyptic earth inhabited by aliens and humans alike. In Defiance, Rath plays the role of Alak Tarr, an alien who falls in love and marries a human female named Christie McCawley. His wife later dies and he struggles to raise their child alone.</p><p>Find out more about Jesse Rath here, including his bio, movies and TV shows, as well as his equally famous sister.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jesse-rath-%e2%80%93-bio></span><strong>Jesse Rath – Bio</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jesse Rath was born on the 11th day of February 1989. He grew up in the city of Montreal, Quebec Province, Canada. There is not much information about Rath’s childhood or educational history. There is, however, no doubt that the actor is well-educated. Jesse Rath commenced his acting career as a teenager in his native Canada. His very first role came in the 2005 sports biopic, The Greatest Game Ever Played. The movie featured Shia LaBeouf and told the real-life story of Francis Ouimet, a poor immigrant who fell in love with golf at a young age. At that time, golf was a sport reserved for the elite but Ouimet did not allow this to deter him. He overcame poverty, as well as his snobbish opponents to win the prestigious US Open in 1913. He made history as the first amateur to win the major. The inspiring biopic was filmed in Rath’s home city of Montreal and he got the part of a runner in the movie. A runner is basically an errand boy in movie production. Despite this lowly status, Jesse Rath was able to gather valuable experience, as well as break into the movie industry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-sister-%e2%80%93-meaghan-rath></span><strong>Family (Sister – Meaghan Rath)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jesse Rath hails from a family of four.

Rath inherited his mom’s Indian heritage and has been cast to play Indian characters.
