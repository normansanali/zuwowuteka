blowtorch and an ax and forced to walk off a cliff before being shot dead.</p><p>His body was found in August in Cathedral Canyon in the Nevada desert after a 911 caller reported it.</p><p>The last person he was seen with, his neighbor Heather Pate, 27, was arrested shortly after.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in US News</h2></p><p>Police also arrested her boyfriend Kevin Dent, 36, and her ex-boyfriend Brad Mehn, 37.</p><p>Pate and her boyfriend Dent allegedly lured Jaggers to her home on August 1 because she thought Jaggers had hurt one of her children, who he sometimes babysat.</p><p>Nye County Sheriff’s Captain David Boruchowitz <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> when Jaggers arrived at the home, he was confronted by Pate and Dent and beaten.</p><p>They then handcuffed the victim and drove to the town of Pahrump, where they met up with Mehn.</p><p>“Upon arriving in Nye County, they met Mehn who led them to an area in the desert where they tortured Jaggers over multiple hours using numerous different weapons,” added Boruchowitz.</p><p>Pate's ex-boyfriend Mehn is the one accused of shooting Jaggers after he fell off the cliff.&nbsp;</p><p>The gunshots were determined to be Jaggers’ cause of death.</p><p>A GoFundMe campaign was started by his mother in an effort to raise money due to his sudden death.</p><p>The fundraiser has raised over $7,700, exceeding its $5,000 goal.</p><p>Jaggers' mother, Kassy Robinson, said he was not a violent person and was not capable of hurting children.</p><p>“Roy was so loving and friendly to everyone he met and the world is now short 1 amazing angel,” she wrote in the GoFundMe description.</p><h2>Was Roy Jaggers married?</h2><p>Jaggers was not believed to be married.</p><p>It is also unclear if he was in a relationship.</p><h2>Who was charged for the death of Roy Jaggers?</h2><p>Mehn, Pate, and Dent were charged with murder with a deadly weapon and kidnapping with a deadly weapon.</p><p>They are being held without bail.</p><p>According to Mehn's lawyers, prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty in the case against him.</p><p>The father of Pate's children claims some of the abuse against Jaggers was documented in video recordings, and the children witnessed some of it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More
